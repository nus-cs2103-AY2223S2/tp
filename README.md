* InternBuddy is written in **Java 11**.
* It is adapted from the [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) project created by
  the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* Libraries and frameworks used: [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson),

* GUI testing is implemented with references from [AddressBook Level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4)
  and [Please Hire Us](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp). We utilised code from these projects to set
  up GUI testing and added our own test cases to test the UI components that we created.
* The feature of Navigating Through Past Commands is primarily adapted from  [HackNet](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp),
  but we added code modifications and test cases.
