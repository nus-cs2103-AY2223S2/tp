# üßë‚Äçüíª CoDoc

CoDoc is a desktop app for students in SoC (School of Computing) to connect with each other for the benefit of their course of study. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CoDoc can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps and networking with people can be easily done.

## üöÄ Installation
To install CoDoc, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have downloaded the latest version of CoDoc under Releases in GitHub.
2. Copy the jar file into an empty folder.
3. Open a command window in that folder.
4. Run the command java -jar CoDoc-{version}.jar e.g., java -jar CoDoc-v1.2.jar (i.e., run the command in the same folder as the jar file).

## üïπÔ∏è Usage
Use the available commands to manage your contacts and connect with students in SoC.

### Command summary
Action | Format, Examples
| --- | --- |
Add	| `add n/NAME y/YEAR c/COURSE e/EMAIL [g/GITHUB] [l/LINKEDIN] [m/YEARTAKEN MODCODE]... [s/SKILL]...`<br />e.g., `add n/Bob Sim y/2 c/2 e/e0823741@nus.edu g/bobby l/linkedin.com/in/bom-sim-086g93847/ m/ay2223s2 cs2103t m/ay2223s2 cs2101 s/python s/java`
View contact | `view INDEX`<br />e.g., `view 3`
View tab | `view C/M/T`<br />e.g., `view c`, `view m` or `view t`
Edit | `edit [n/NAME] [y/YEAR] [c/COURSE] [e/EMAIL] [g/GITHUB] [l/LINKEDIN] [m/MODINDEX YEARTAKEN MODCODE]... [s/SKILL]...`<br />e.g., `edit n/Bob Lim m/2 ay2223s2 cs2109s`
Find	name | `find NAME [MORENAMES]`<br />e.g., `find Bob Sam Pete`
Find module | `find m/ MODCODE [MOREMODCODES]`<br />e.g., `find m/cs2013t cs2109s cs2107`
Find skills | `find s/ SKILL [MORESKILLS]`<br />e.g., `find s/java python` 
List | `view` the default list of all contacts
Delete | `delete INDEX`<br />e.g., `delete 3`
Clear all contacts | `clear`
Help | `help`

- Words in `UPPERCASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br />e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Bob Sim`.
- Items in square brackets are optional.<br />e.g., `n/NAME [s/SKILL]` can be used as `n/Bob Sim s/python` or as `n/Bob Sim`.
- Items with ‚Ä¶ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br />e.g., `[s/SKILL]‚Ä¶` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/java`, `s/java s/python` etc.
- To execute View tab or Edit command, a contact must be loaded up at the side, these commands target the current person loaded.
- Parameters can be in any order.<br />e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME y/YEAR c/COURSE`, `y/YEAR c/COURSE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br />e.g. if you specify `c/com eng c/bza`, only `c/com eng` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `clear`, `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br />e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
- üíæ CoDoc data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.
