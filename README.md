# This is Contact nUS.<br>

## Target User:
#### NUS Computing Students who are more tech-savvy than the general population and are also fast typists.

## Value Proposition:
#### In order for NUS computing students to function effectively and productively in university
It is important for them to keep track of: 

- Lecturers and their contact details
- Tutors/teaching assistants and their contact details
- Locations of classes
- Online links provided by lecturer and tutors where slides or other resources are uploaded (Eg. Canvas, Google Drive) 
- Deadlines for handing in assignments
- Lecture and tutorial timings
- Exam timings 

 ## Example usages:

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Contact nUS_) used for managing 
contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) 
  than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
