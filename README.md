# FAid
FAid is an app adapted from AddressBook 3 to help Financial Advisors manage their clients and meetings.
We aim to tailor this product towards Financial Advisors such as Insurance Agents, Investment Advisors and Real Estate Agents.
It can be difficult for a busy Financial Advisor to keep track of all their customers and meetings with them, and we hope to make this process fast and efficient.

* This is a client and meeting management application built for financial advisors<br>
  Example usages:
  * Add contact details and relevant information about a client
  * Schedule meetings with clients
  * See overview of meetings for the day
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FAid_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `FAid` (Full Form: `Financial Advisor Aid`)
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[FAid Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w12-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
