## About the Project
* _ConnectUS_ is a desktop application that targets users can type fast, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the visual benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br>
  * This is a software engineering project for the module **CS2103T Software Engineering** by the National University of Singapore (NUS).
  * It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base that is **written in OOP fashion**. 
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `ConnectUS` because it created to help NUS Computing students _connect_ with each other. Users can keep track of each others' contact information, modules, CCAs etc. at the tip of their fingers.
