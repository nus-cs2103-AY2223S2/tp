# tuition center admin managing system (TMS)
Tutor managing system (TMS) is a **desktop application designed for private tutors managing students, optimized for 
use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
TMS utilizes your fast typing ability to execute your management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.


## Target User
- Has a need to manage a significant number of tutees
- Prefer desktop apps over other types
- Can type fast
- Prefers typing to mouse interactions
- Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps


## Value Proposition
Manage tutees faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
