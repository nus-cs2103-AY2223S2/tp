* Wingman is a modal manager for managing airplanes, pilots, crews, flights, and locations. It seeks to provide a highly efficient way of resource management for airline managers, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
