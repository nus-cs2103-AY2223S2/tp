* This is **a project made by CS2103T-T15-2 group**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FitBook_) used by fitness instructors to keep track
of their clients and respective details such as appointments and exercise routines.
  * It comes with **features such as adding clients details, editing, finding and many more which you can find in the user guide**.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `FitBook` because it tracks the membership detail for Personal Training customers.
* * For the detailed documentation of FitBook, see the [FitBook Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t15-2.github.io/tp/)
