* This is **Clock-Work**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project is adapted from an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details, and modified for use as a task management application.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is now called `Clock-Work`. Clock-Work is a **desktop application for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see **[Clock-Work product website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w13-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
