## Description
OfficeConnect is a task management tool tailored to meet the needs of managers working in corporate settings. 
In today's office environment, it can be challenging for managers to keep track of the workload of their subordinates,
which can lead to work overload and coordination issues among employees.

OfficeConnect addresses these problems by providing managers with enhanced visibility into their subordinates'

managers can streamline their task management process, which leads to improved productivity and a more effective 
and productive work environment.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* This is a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students.
  * As a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * As a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written codebase that is bigger (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3`, etc.).
* For detailed documentation of this project, see the [Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3).
