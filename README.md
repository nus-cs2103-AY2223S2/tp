# Calidr

Calidr is a **time-management and scheduling calendar application** that offers integrated support for university students to manage their classes, assignments, deadlines, and tasks from one place.

## Target User
Calidr is targeted towards NUS students who prefer using a _command-line interface (CLI)_ to manage their schedule and tasks.

## Value Proposition
Calidr is designed to help students manage their time and tasks more effectively. With Calidr, students can:

* Add, edit, and delete tasks such as assignments, exams, and other important events.
* Keep track of their tasks in a flexible calendar view, making it easy to see what needs to be done and when.
* Tag their classes as lectures, tutorials, and assignments, helping them stay organized by course.
* Set priority levels for tasks, helping them focus on what's most important.
* Search for tasks quickly and easily, by name, description, date, priority, or other criteria.
