* This is a **team project (tp) for Software Engineering (SE) students in CS2103T**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Add patients and Add doctors information (particulars, patients bill, medication, etc)
  * Find the specific person and doctor
  * Delete person based on name instead of index
  * Retrieve patient/doctors information
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called MediConnect) used for managing patient/doctor details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `MediConnect` because it facilitates a connection between healthcare providers and individual patients.
* This project was based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the **[SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w13-1.github.io/tp)**.
