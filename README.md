Welcome to the Le Tracker project!
* Our goal is to help create a stress-free learning environment for all students!<br>
* Le Tracker enables students to **easily log their lecture progress**. <br>
  Example usages:
  * add-module /code CS2040 /name Data Structures & Algorithms
  * mark /module CS2040 /lecture 1 /video lecture_01-part-1

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
