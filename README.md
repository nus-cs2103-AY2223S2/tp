# The Intern's Ship

Designed with **internship-seeking university students** in mind, **The Intern’s Ship (TinS)** aims to make
**managing your internship applications** fuss-free. Despite being optimised for use via the keyboard,
you will still be able to enjoy the benefits of having a visual display.

With TinS, you can conveniently and efficiently manage, coordinate and keep track of your internship applications
all in one place.

### Notable Features

* Calendar View: [`calendar`](#opens-the-calendar-page--calendar)
