# Introduction

Mycelium is a desktop application aimed at helping freelance web developers
manage clients and projects from multiple online sources. All interactions
with Mycelium are through text commands, allowing for efficient manipulation
of data while benefiting from the ease of viewing offered by the Graphical
User Interface.

# Main Layout

As shown in the mockup above, Mycelium has two main tabs. One tab lists all
existing projects, and the other lists existing clients.
