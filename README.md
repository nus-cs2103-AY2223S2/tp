This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* This is the project repository for T12 team 1 of CS2103T for AY2022/2023
Semester 2. The name of this project is Patientist, a combination of the
words patient and list.
* This project seeks to streamline the management systems of hospitals, with
useful features such as but not limited to:
  * Tracking patient records
  * Tracking staff assignments
  * Individual patient status tracking
  * etc.
* This application is developed with command line interface optimisation. Reason:
  * Hospital staff are likely to have to use this system heavily in their jobs
    and will thus become familiar with the system quickly
  * Thus, this application has a high skill cap where a skilled user comfortable
    with commmand line interfaces can get the job done faster than with GUI applications
