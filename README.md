Hi there,

Welcome to Where Got Time (WGT) - a perfect desktop app dedicate to managing your events and plan out your
meetings with your friends and family. It is developed for university student, who can type fast to efficiently
keep track of all of their events and their friends' events via a Command Line Interface.

We are sure that as a university student, you have struggled to find a date that all your friends are free to meet.
Fret not because _WGT_ got your back! This desktop app aims to **automate the process** for you, saving
you all the pain and "scratching head moment" you face when trying to find a time that all of you are free!

Not just that, WGT allows you to **keep track of all your events** such as your weekly tutorials,
lectures and cca timings. No more digging through your pinned messages or photo album to find your timetable
anymore!
