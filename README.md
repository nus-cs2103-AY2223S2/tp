- This is a **project for admin clerks working in the military that handles the information of many military personnel**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - manage the rank, section, platoon, company, unit, etc. of many military personnel
  - track different leaves of personnel for admin purposes
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

- For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[AIMS Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w10-3.github.io/tp/)**.
- This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
