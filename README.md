* SOCket is a **desktop app for NUS Software Engineering Students to manage the contact information of their peers and professors.**
* SOCket is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
  * If you can type fast, SOCket can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* It is named `SOCket`, referring to the School of Computing, _SOC_, as well as how it helps with contacting others, like a network _socket_.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SOCket Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t12-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
