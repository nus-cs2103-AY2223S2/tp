* `Paidlancers` is **desktop application for freelancers to keep track of their events and contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the option of using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.<br>
* The app manages eventsâ€™ information and respective contact person faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
* The name `Paidlancers` is inspired by a play-on-word of the word "free" in freelancers.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Paidlancers Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t11-3.github.io/tp/)**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

Thank you for your time! :)
