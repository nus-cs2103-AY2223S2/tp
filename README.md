# Bookopedia

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

**Bookopedia** is a desktop application specifically built for parcel delivery riders, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This enables delivery riders to be able to quickly plan their deliveries by typing in commands and still be able to view them in an organized manner.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Bookopedia Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103-w16-1.github.io/tp/)**.


This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
