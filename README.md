* This is our **Team Project for CS2103T-T11-4**.
* HospiSearch (HS) is a **desktop app for managing patients and hospital admin details, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* Users will be able to add patients alongside their contact info and address.
* Users will be able to find patients according to their names.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
