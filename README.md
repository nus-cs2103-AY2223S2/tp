# InternEase

InternEase is a **powerful and innovative desktop app designed to streamline the internship application process primarily for Computer Science undergraduates**. With its optimized **combination of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, InternEase offers users the best of both worlds - the speed and efficiency of a CLI for those who can type quickly, and the user-friendly experience of a GUI for those who prefer a visual interface. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned CLI user or a first-time applicant new to work environment, InternEase makes it easy to keep track of your progress, deadlines, and follow-up actions, so you can focus on landing your dream internship.
