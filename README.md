This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

The problem addressed is to assist in digitizing patient details. By converting traditional paper records into electronic ones, healthcare providers can easily and efficiently organize and manage patient data. This not only saves time and reduces the risk of errors, but it also makes it easier to retrieve and update the information when needed. Additionally, with the use of electronic scheduling systems, healthcare providers can easily schedule and reschedule appointments, improving the overall experience for both patients and staff. Overall, digitizing patient details helps to improve the quality of care and make the healthcare delivery process more streamlined and efficient.  

The product is intended for use by medical professionals, specifically doctors or their receptionists, who are experienced with computers and currently using paper records to store patient information. With this solution, they will be able to better manage their patient data, including updating, accessing and adding new patient details easily. 

This solution digitizes patient records and reduces errors, such as wrong updates. Moreover, it helps to reduce the time taken to organize, search and audit check the patient information, thus making scheduling appointments easier and providing efficient access to updated information.
