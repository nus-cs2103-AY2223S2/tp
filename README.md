* This is **event tracker project for NUS CS2040 Teaching Assistants (TA)**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * for tutorial TAs to keep track of consultations and tutorial related tasks
  * for lab TAs to keep track of lab assignments, lab questions and markings
* The project is built from an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `TrAcker` because it is a word play on "TA Tracker".
* For the detailed documentation of the starting point of the project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
