# GoodMatch

GoodMatch is an all-in-one recruitment management platform for hiring managers, allowing them to manage their job listings and job applicants.

## Problem Address

During hiring season, many people will apply for the same role and hiring is usually a long process that last for weeks. While there are already Application Tracking Systems to track applicants and Calendly to schedule interviews with applicants, the tools are not all-in-one. We aim to create an all-in-one solution for managing applicants during the hiring process.

## Feature

* Manage listings and applicants
* Track applicants status (to be implemented)
* Coordinate information about applicants (to be implemented)

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
