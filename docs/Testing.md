## Running tests

There are two ways to run tests.

* **Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner**
  * To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
  * To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package,
    test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`
* **Method 2: Using Gradle**
  * Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

While there are libraries such as **[TestFX](http://testfx.github.io/TestFX/)** that can be used to run end-to-end tests for JavaFX GUIs and mitigate the need for User Acceptance
Testing (UAT), as of now it has poor support for Ubuntu and thus cannot run in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment. We aim to add these tests in
the future to automate UAT.

## Types of tests

This project has three types of tests:

1. *Unit tests* targeting the lowest level methods/classes.<br>
   e.g. `seedu.recipe.commons.StringUtilTest`
1. *Integration tests* that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
   e.g. `seedu.recipe.storage.StorageManagerTest`
1. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.<br>
   e.g. `seedu.recipe.logic.LogicManagerTest`

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

As our product has many Graphic User Interface features, we recommend that you follow the UAT procedures, as defined [here](DeveloperGuide.md#appendix-instructions-for-user-acceptance-testing)
