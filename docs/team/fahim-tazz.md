### Project: TutorPro

TutorPro is a desktop app designed to help private tutors manage their student information effectively.
With TutorPro, tutors can easily keep track of their students' details, lesson plans, homeworks, and exams, all in one place.
TutorPro uses a combination of GUI and CLI to provide an aesthetically-pleasing UI for viewing student's information, while promising the
speed and control of a CLI. Whether you're managing a handful of students or hundreds,

TutorPro can help you streamline your workflow and make your tutoring experience much more efficient.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: Track School name and Grade level in Student's profile.
    - What it does: Allows user to add an optional School name and Grade level.
    - Justification: This feature enables tutors to tag students with their School name and Grade Level, for easy reference on the student list.
    - Highlights: This feature can allow future enhancements for batch processing, such as adding a homework to all students of a particular grade level.
