### Project: CookHub

CookHub is a desktop application for student chefs to store and check their recipes, especially for those who only have limited budget and time to cook themselves.
It is written in Java and uses JavaFX to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view a list of groceries to buy for a list of given recipe indexes (Pull request #158)
  * What it does: Allows the user to see all the groceries they need to cook a particular set of recipes.
  * Justification: Helps the user plan out their trip to the grocery store and know what ingredients they need to buy

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for users to store and save their recipes after closing the application (Pull request #89)
