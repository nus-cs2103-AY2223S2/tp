### Project: PowerCards

PowerCards enable university students to input a pool of information (question-answer pairs) of their desired topic and utilize the application to practice active recall of this information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add, delete, show, edit, find cards of a deck. (PR [#62](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/62), [#87](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/87), [#230](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/230), [#232](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/232))
    * What it does: Allows users to add, delete, show, edit, find cards to their currently selected deck. 
    * Justification: This feature is vital for PowerCards, as it is used by the user to manage their cards.
    * Highlights: Implementing this feature required thorough understanding of how commands are executed in the program. It also required knowledge on how the `Model`, `LogicManager`, and `Storage` class works.
