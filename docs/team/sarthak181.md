### Project: The Intern's Ship

**The Intern's Ship (TinS)** is a desktop application for **internship-seeking university students** to more efficiently
and conveniently manage, coordinate and keep track of their numerous internship applications. Despite being optimised
for use via Command Line Interface (CLI), TinS also provides its user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enable
its users to navigate the application with ease.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find Internship Applications with specific criteria
    * What it does:
        * The first iteration enables users to find internship applications that have exactly the specific fields inputted by the user.  
          [(#114)](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/114)
        * The second iteration enables user to find internships as long as they contain a keyword in the specific fields inputted by the user.
          [(#123)](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/123)
    * Justification: This feature is vital for users to use TinS, as it aids users to find internships they are concerned about. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find Internship Events with specific criteria
    * What it does:
        * The first iteration enables users to find internship events that have exactly the specific fields inputted by the user.

        * The second iteration enables user to find internships events as long as they contain a keyword in the specific fields inputted by the user.
