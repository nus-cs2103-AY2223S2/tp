### Project: CookHub

CookHub is a desktop application for student chefs to store and check their recipes, 
especially for those who only have limited budget and time to cook themselves.
It is written in Java and uses JavaFX to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view a detailed view of a recipe with on-click action. (Pull 
  request [#96](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/96))
  * What it does: allows the user to see a detailed view of a recipe one at a time on the right panel by 
    clicking on a recipe on the left panel.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user needs to view the 
    details of the recipe such as instructions, cooking time and ingredients before starting to cook. 
    Allowing the user to click on each recipe to view it increases intuitiveness of the product.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `star` and `unstar` a recipe dynamically. (Pull request [#213](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/213))
  * What it does: allows the user to add a recipe to their favourites or remove it from their favourites.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will have recipes that 
    they like and will need to indicate which ones are their favourites.
  
* **Enhancements to existing features**: Updated the ability to add tags to each recipe and delete them as 
  necessary. (Pull request [#131](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/131), [#135](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/135))
  * What it does: allows user to add one or more tags to each recipe and allows the user to remove them.
  * Justification: This feature enables users to find recipes with tag names using the `find tag/` 
    function and easily categorize a recipe for easy and convenient viewing.

* **Enhancement to existing features**: Improved the GUI. (Pull request [#143](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/143), [#122](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/122), 
  [#81](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/81))
  * Moved the `recipe card list panel` to the left, and added a new `recipe details panel` to the
      right.
  * Updated GUI to fit CookHub's agenda.
  * Made GUI responsive when resizing the application window.

      * Added documentation for the `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands. (Pull request [#144](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/144))
      * Created annotated images of command formats for clearer presentation. (Pull request [#235](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/235))
      * Created annotated GUI images for clearer presentation. (Pull request [#243](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/243))

    * Developer Guide:
      * Updated architecture diagrams to reflect project design. (Pull request [#118](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/118), [#112](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/112/files))
