### Project: sprINT

**sprINT** is an **internship-tracking application** that was created to assist students in their internship hunt.

Students often face a great administrative burden in keeping track of the high volume of job or internship
 applications. With sprINT, students can easily manage details of their internship applications,
 and enjoy functionalities like sorting their application entries by deadlines,
 or finding a specific application with a keyword.

sprINT is a desktop application that is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI) users, 
 while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.
