### Project: Advis.io

Advis.io (AIO) is a desktop app for managing clients information, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).C.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit policies to a client.
  * What it does: Given the updated policy information, the user can edit a policy to the client selected.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now edit policies to a client to meet the needs of the client demands. Given that there are different financial cycles, it's always good to remain relevant by updating policies to the best policies available in the market.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an
    in-depth analysis of adding a different type of list to the client class.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete policies to a client.
  * What it does: Given the chosen policy, the user can now delete the policy attached the client selected.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now delete policies that are not relevant to the client anymore, so that entire tracking process is neater.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add appointment to a client.
  * What it does: Given the chosen appointment, the user can now add the necessary appointment details with his or her client.
  * Justification: This features improves the product significantly because a user can now add appointments to meet his or her clients.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to remove an appointment to a client.
  * What it does: Once the user meets up with the client, he or she can remove the appointment that was set for.
  * Justification: Appointments that are settled for should be removed from the application to make it neater.
