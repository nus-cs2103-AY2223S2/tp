### Project: NextBigFish

NextBigFish is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view summary of contact information.
    * What it does: allows the user to view the contact counts, existing tags of all the contacts, total potential earnings, and all companies.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily view a breakdown of all the contacts in the application. Being able to see a list of tags and companies allow the user to know what he/she can filter the list by and what he/she can search for.
    * Highlights: For future development, can consider adding more information that are relevant to the window.
    * Credits: *The existing help window was used as a reference when implementing this feature.*
