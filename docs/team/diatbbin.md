### Project: PowerConnect

PowerConnect is a fully customized offline application for tuition and school teachers to manage students' and parents' administrative details. While it has limited features at this stage, plans for future PowerConnect releases to update features and usage capabilites have been made with detailed timeline.
The aim of this product is to eventually be a useful tool that is used in conjunction with Learning Management System (LMS) tools currently in the market to aid teachers in managing students. <br>

PowerConnect is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). PowerConnect helps teachers in tracking and updating students' particulars.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete students from PowerConnect.
  * What it does: Allows users to delete students from PowerConnect via the Student Delete Command.
  * Justification: This feature contributes significantly to the product as one of the intended features in allowing teachers to delete students from their student list.
  * Highlights: The implementation was slightly challenging as it required changes to the ab3's deleteCommand to allow deletion of student by their class and index number instead of their index in the list. There is also a need to update parents of deleted students.
  * * Credits: *AB3's delete Command, T17-2's DeleteDepartmentCommand*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete parents from PowerConnect.
  * What it does: Allows users to delete parents from PowerConnect via the Parent Delete Command.
  * Justification: This feature contributes significantly to the product as one of the intended features in allowing teachers to delete parents from their parent list.
  * Highlights: The implementation was slightly challenging as it required changes to the ab3's deleteCommand to allow deletion of parent by their name and phone number instead of their index in the list. For parent delete, we also added implementation to prevent deletion of parent when there is a student attached.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit students from PowerConnect.
  * What it does: Allows users to edit students from PowerConnect via the Student Edit Command.
  * Justification: This feature contributes significantly to the product as one of the intended features in allowing teachers to edit students from their students list.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging and tedious as the student class has more than 12 details that can be edited. If the parent information in a student is edited using StudentEditCommand, that parent and all the students attached to that parent will be updated too.
