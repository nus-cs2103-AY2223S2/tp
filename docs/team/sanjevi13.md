### Project: ExpressLibrary

ExpressLibrary is an app for librarians to keep track of books borrowed by students.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Created Book Class in v1.1**:

  - What it does: Created the initial book class in the initial milestone.
  - Justification: This is the base of the entire app and everything we develop starts from here
  - Highlights: This was initially given to me and Glen, but it was a hard task to split, so we sat down and coded out the class together

- **Code contributed**:

  - Added the initial book object in v1.1 that was modified in later milestones, and also modified JSON property, done on Glen's computer ([Glen's commit](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/tp/commit/668f87ca849a2cc850b409df46d3e0dcc555df82))
  - Refactored code base to show difference in commands for person and book ([#82](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/82))
  - Update find commands ([#107](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/107))
  - Resolved some bugs from PED and added several test cases([#181](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/181))

- **Project management**:

  - Reviewed pull requests from Jarrett, and some from Glen

- **Enhancements to existing features**:
  - Upgraded the find functions for both book and person such that it allows to find objects even when only part of the name/title is input ([#107](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/107))
- **Documentation**:

  - User Guide:
    - Documented all person commands and command summary
    - Assisted project leader in reviewing of changes made to User Guide
  - Developer Guide:
    - Updated all related diagrams to reflect changes to Person classes
