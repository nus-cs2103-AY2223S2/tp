### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)

Enhance life with WIFE! Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment <WIFE/> helps users to manage their items in the 
fridge. With this, one never has to worry about optimizing storage and organisation of food items in their refrigerator!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create new tag.
  * What it does: Allow user to create their unique pre-defined tags.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can create a unique tag that the
    user wish to use for classification of the food item that the user owns in the fridge.
  * Highlights: This feature is useful when the user wish to tag food of a certain categories of tag the food to the
    user's name. The nature of `Tag` is similar to `Food`. Since `Tag` is another entity in WIFE, similar to `Food`, 
    their implementation follows a similar structure.

  <br/>
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all the created tags.
  * What it does: Displays to the user the list of tags that had been created in WIFE.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently list
  all the tags that had been created in the system for easier reference. This allows the user to easily
  select the tags that user wish to tag their food item with.
  * Highlights: This feature is useful when the user wish to tag food or filter out food based on the tags
  available. The list is also sorted in lexicographical ordering so its easier for the user to navigate the
  list of available tags.
  
  <br/>
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add tags to the food items.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add valid tags to any valid food item in WIFE that they wish to categorise.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently classify
    the food item based on the food's unique characteristic. It also allows for easier search of the food item
    based on the tags allocated for the food item.
  * Highlights: This enhancement allows for easier classification of food item in the fridge and will ease the filtering
    of the food item in the fridge.
