### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE) 
Enhance life with WIFE! Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment &lt;WIFE/&gt; helps users to manage their 
items in the fridge. With this, one never has to worry about optimizing storage and organization of food items in their 
refrigerator!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add foods.
    * What it does: allows the user to add their a food item to the fridge. 
    * One important note: Initially, this feature does not allow users to add tags to new food items. This is because we want to encourage users to utilize pre-existing tags, which are consistent and standardized.
    * Justification: The decision to use pre-existing tags was based on best practices in user interface design. By limiting the number of tags that users can create, we ensure that the tags are more consistent and easy to understand. Additionally, pre-existing tags can make it easier for users to search and filter their fridge contents.

* **New Feature**: Improved User Interface (UI) for displaying fridge contents
    * What it does:  Enables users to easily view the contents of their fridge and feedback provided.
    * Justification: Our group has updated the GUI to make it more user-friendly. We have achieved this by making the display brighter and reducing sharp edges that can strain the eyes.
    * Highlights: Implementing these changes was challenging as the FXML files and CSS files were difficult to work with as they required a deep understanding of the JavaFX framework to work with.. The updated fxml files had to look good together and be consistent with the new design while still functioning correctly. The css had to be updated to fit the new display, ensuring that the overall design was cohesive and visually appealing. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view foods.
    * What it does: allows the user to view their food items in the fridge.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to view their food items in the fridge. This is useful as it allows users to get a better overview of a specific item in the fridge.
    * Highlights: This feature was challenging to implement as it required a deep understanding of the JavaFX framework and its ability to parse commands and update the view. It also required a clear understanding of the interaction between the view and the model.

* **Feature Not Implemented in Final Product**: Dynamic panel display feature.
    * What it does: This feature would have allowed users to view different panels, such as the fridge, statistics, and details of a specific food item, in a single display port.
    * Justification: The goal of this feature was to make the product more flexible and adaptable to future iterations that might require additional views or information to be displayed on the same screen.
    * Highlights: Developing this feature would have been challenging as it required a deep understanding of the JavaFX framework and its ability to parse commands and update the view. It also required a clear understanding of the interaction between the view and the model.
    * Rationale for rejection: While this feature had the potential to add significant value to the product, it was not implemented in the final version due to constraints on resources and time. The team decided that the current UI was sufficient for the initial release, and prioritized other features that were more critical for the first iteration. However, this feature could be revisited in future releases or updates when there is more time and resources available to test and implement it properly.
