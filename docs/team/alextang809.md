### Project: TeachMeSenPai

TeachMeSenpai is a student managing application specially customised for teaching assistants who have a lot of students to keep track of. It is tailored to assist the user in monitoring their students' progress, and details. TeachMeSenpai is optimised for fast-typists with a Command Line Interface (CLI) so users can easily edit their student's details, with the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) so users can conveniently view their student entries.
