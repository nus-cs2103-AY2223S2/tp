## **Project: SportSync**

SportSync is a desktop address book application used for coaching student athletes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## **New Features**
### Sort function [\#29](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/29)

Added the ability to sort the contact list.

  * **What it does:** Calling sort will automatically sort the list of contacts in alphabetical order.
  * **Justification:** This feature gives convenience to the user by letting them know where a specific contact can be found in relation to others.
  * **Highlights:** Implementing this feature involved understanding the complex code flow and the relationship between many classes.

### Undo/Redo function [\#50](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/50)

Added the ability to undo and redo previously entered commands.

  * **What it does:** Calling undo will undo the last user-entered command while calling redo will redo the last user-entered command.
  * **Justification:** This feature saves the user's time when they accidentally make mistakes while typing.
  * **Highlights:** Implementing this feature involved rigorous understanding of class instances and the pass-by-reference concept.
  * **Credits:** The previous team that worked on AddressBook 3, as I used their proposed implementation for this.
