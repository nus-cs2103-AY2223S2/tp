### Project: Pied Piper

I took part in developing Pied Piper, a task management app that helps current and future university student
leaders take charge of their group projects. It allows students to more easily manage their group project,
and keep track of their teammates' progress while being able to rate their performances upon completion of
their assigned tasks.

### Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature**: STATUS for task
  * What it does: allows users to quickly understand the current status of each task based on colour coded tags.
  * Justification: the user does not have to read through the task details to identify if the task is completed, is due soon or is overdue. Each status is represented using predefined colours. This is a nice to have feature.
  * Pull Requests: [\#95](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/95), [\#184](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/184)


* **New Feature**: Dark Mode
  * What it does: allows users to easily switch to a darker theme.

* **Update Feature**: Role for team members
  * What it does: allows users to give each team members roles.
