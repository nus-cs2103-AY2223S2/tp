### Project: SOCket

SOCket is a desktop application for NUS Software Engineering Students to manage the contact information of their peers and professors. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `GitHubProfile` class to represent the GitHub username of a `Person` [\#74](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/74)
  * What it does: Stores the GitHub username of a `Person`, and validates the input
  * Justification: Allows the GitHub username of contacts in `SOCket` to be stored, allowing users to easily retrieve the information needed to find the contact on GitHub
  * Highlights: `VALIDATION_REGEX` ensures the validity of any input stored as a `GitHubProfile` (does not guarantee that it exists, only that it is valid)
  * Credits: *{Input validation based on form validation from [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join)}*

* **New Feature**: `Language` class to represent proficiency in a programming language of a `Person` [\#75](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/75)
  * What it does: Stores the programming languages a `Person`, and validates the input
  * Justification: Allows the programming language proficiencies of contacts in `SOCket` to be stored, allowing users to easily view the proficiencies of a contact
  * Highlights: Simple input validation using `VALIDATION_REGEX` (does not guarantee existence of input as a programming language)
  * Credits: *{-}*

* **New Feature**: `undo` and `redo` commands [\#99](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/99)
  * What it does: Allows users to undo/redo changes
  * Justification: Users are able to revert/restore unintended changes to `SOCket`
  * Highlights: Stores the states of `SOCket` to allow for a simple implementation of the undo/redo functionality
  * Credits: *{This feature was implemented as proposed in [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#proposed-undoredo-feature)}*

* **New Feature**: `Project` class to represent a project (in collaboration with [@dillongoh](https://github.com/dillongoh)) [\#130](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/130)
  * What it does: Allows users to store information about a project, including details regarding the project repository, deadline, and members
  * Justification: Users are able to easily manage and retrieve information regarding the project
  * Highlights: `VALIDATION_REGEX` and `isValid*` methods for fields ensure validity of inputs stored in `Project` instance (does not guarantee that `ProjectRepoHost` or `ProjectRepoName` exist, only that they are valid); `Project` instances are stored in an additional list in the `socket.json` data file, with its own copies of the `Person` instances that are members of the `Project`; references to the `Person` instances are restored upon reading in the `socket.json` data file
  * Credits: *{-}*

* **New Feature**: `deletepj` command to delete existing projects [\#150](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/150)
  * What it does: Allows users to delete existing projects
  * Justification: Users are able to remove finished projects from `SOCket`
  * Highlights: `JUnit` tests to test command functionality
  * Credits: *{-}*
