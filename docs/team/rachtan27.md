### Project: NeoBook

NeoBook is a desktop application for NUS students to better manage their contacts and the events they have scheduled with them. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a 'Select Command' that displays the details of the corresponding index (PR [#138](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/138))
  * Justification: Using the mouse to click on contacts to display requires users' hands to leave the keyboard which may slow down the process, thus having a select functionality
    in the command line prevents this.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=rachtan27&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
  * `to be added soon`
