### Project: FriendlyLink

FriendlyLink is a personnel information management tool designed for Voluntary Welfare Organisations to keep elderly and volunteer records, and pair them up efficiently and effectively.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability search for people by their attributes.
  * What it does: allows the user to search for people and their related pairings by their attributes. Multiple different attributes can be searched for in one command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can look for information from a specific group of people.
  * Highlights: This feature allows user to search with a substring for some attributes instead of exactly matching the attribute details.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list paired and unpaired people.
  * What it does: allows the user to list people who have been paired or those who have not been paired.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because pairing is the one of the main features of the app and a user should be able to see people who do not have a pairing to know who to pair next.
  * Highlights: This feature is built on top of the list feature with an extra parameter being specified to list paired or unpaired people.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=wz2k&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Kept track of deadlines.
  * Managed releases `v1.4` and `v1.4.demo` on GitHub.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactor most of AB3's person related stuff into FriendlyLink's elderly and volunteer version. (Pull requests [\#81](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/81))
  * Wrote additional test cases for existing features.
  * Cleaned up Javadocs. (Pull requests [\#117](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/117))
  * Cleaned up logging messages.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `list` and `find`.
        * Changed documentation of `edit` feature to `edit_elderly` and `edit_volunteer` features.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `find` feature with 2 types of UML diagrams.
        * Added instructions for manual testing in appendix.

* **Community**:
