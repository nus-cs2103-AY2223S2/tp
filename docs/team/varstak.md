### Project: Ultron

Ultron is a system that assists students in tracking their internship applications by organizing their internships and monitoring the status of each application. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
    * Added `upcoming` feature
      * Drafted the idea of `upcoming` as a feature to remind users of upcoming events.
      * Coded out the entire logic of `upcoming` feature to match the specifications of my group members.
      * Created the parser for the `upcoming` command to be consistent with the implementations of the rest of the commands.
      * After change to keydates, refactored the feature to adapt to the new date formats.
