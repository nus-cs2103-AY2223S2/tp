# Overview
Careflow is a desktop application for patient and drug inventory management of medical clinics, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Careflow can get your patient and drugs management tasks done faster than traditional applications.
