### Project: MODCheck

MODcheck is a desktop app to allow students to easily check the module coordinators, professors and teaching
assistants in the modules they are taking

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a view command.
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the full contact details of all users stored within ModCheck.
    * Justification: This feature ensures the privacy of MODCheck's users as their contact details are not displayed openly.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. 
                  It required an in-depth analysis of the existing code base and design alternatives to incorporate this feature. 
                  The implementation was challenging as it require changes to existing commands and code analysis of the existing implementation to support existing and future commands.  


* **New Feature**: Added an export command.
    * What it does: Allows the user to export selected contacts from ModCheck
    * Justification: This feature enhances the experience of using ModCheck as it allows for the easy exporting of selected contact details.
    * Highlights: This feature was somewhat challenging as I had to learn how other existing features were implemented and follow the developer guide extensively.
      It was also the first time for me experiencing writing quite a few test cases to ensure that my feature works as expected.
