### Project: SOCket

SOCket is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `remove` command [\#88](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/88)
    * What it does: Allows users to remove specific field value based on the input command.
    * Justification: Users are able to remove any field value of the contact information without excess typing.
    * Highlights: Ensures that only unwanted field value are removed from contact information.
    * Credits: *{-}*

* **New Feature**: `view` command [\#108](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/108)
  * What it does: Allows users to view a specific contact detail.
  * Justification: Users are able to view detailed information of a contact by `view` command or click on the contact card.
  * Highlights: Places the selected contact into the contact detail panel to display all the detailed information.
  * Credits: *{-}*

* **New Feature**: `clearpj` command [\#154](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/154)
    * What it does: Allows users to clear off all the project in the project list
    * Justification: Users are able to clear all projects in a single command.
    * Highlights: Ability to delete all the projects.
    * Credits: *{This feature idea was adopted from `clear` command}*

* **New Feature**: Added keyboard shortcut [\#203](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/203)
  * What it does: Allows users to perform `undo`, `redo` and `exit` command using keyboard shortcut.

  * Highlights: Make use of well-known keyboard shortcut to perform undo/redo/exit function.
  * Credits: *{This feature idea was adopted from `help` keyboard shortcut of AddressBook-Level3}*

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=huanghao1998&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated `clear` command to allow users to remove group of contacts associated with the given tag(s) [\#127](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/127)
    * Updated the restriction on the number of tags associated to each contact to prevent misuse of the feature [\#172](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/172)
    * Improved the UI in `HelpWindow` by categorising commands into different subgroups so that users can look for the command guide easily [\#190](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/190)
    * Improved the UI and UX in `MainWindow` [\#108](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/108), [\#117](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/117), [\#128](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/128), [\#162](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/162)
      * Reallocated the result display and command box from the top of the application to the bottom as it allows for a more natural and intuitive user flow, with the display panel at the top.
      * Seperated the contact display into 2 components, contact list panel and contact detail panel, using split panel. Contact list displays minimal information while contact detail panel displays all the information related to the contact.
      * Added project list panel alongside with contact display, both located at the top of the page and occupying 70% of the page space as they are critical components of the application and play a central role in its functionality, so that users can quickly access and interact with these features.
      * Improved the contact list by allowing users to click on the card and displays contact detail of the contact in contact detail panel.
      * Improved contact card by automatically wrapping tags based on the width of the contact card.
      * Improved the shape of the display card from sharp to round edges, so that the overall aesthetic of the application is enhanced. The round edges create a smoother and more polished look which help to soften the visual impact of the display card, which can give the impression of a more refined and elegant design.
      * Implemented a hover effect on contact list so that users can quickly identify which elements on the page are interactive and clickable.
