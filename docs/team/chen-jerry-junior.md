### Project: Team Builder

Team Builder is a desktop personal contacts book application used by the user to form a team for any event. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Show
  * What it does: allows the user to list all people under certain specified teams.
  * Justification: Users might want to list all people under a certain team they created. Rather than checking everyone's person card, they can just use `show` followed by the target team name. This is especially useful when users want to compare a team's skill requirements with skills possessed by the members.
  * Highlights: Able to show all members who belong to multiple teams, use `show` followed by names of multiple teams that are separated by spaces.

* **New Feature**: Major
  * What it does: allows the user to add a person with a given major.
  * Justification: This is useful when a user want to create a team of students with specified major. A major field also help the user to create cross-disciplinary teams.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands such as `find` `add` and `edit`.

* **New Feature**: GUI for Team List
  * What it does: adds a TeamListPanel and a TeamCard to allow the user to navigate through the existing teams.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is necessary for a user to see the existing teams to use our product.
  * Highlights: This feature allows the team list to automatically update regarding the command `create` and `remove` for teams and `edit` for adding people into teams.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Update `find` command so that the user can use `find` to search for people by their names, skills (tags), and major.
