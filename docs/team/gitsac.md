### Overview

FastTrack is a desktop application to help you keep track of daily expenses, optimised for use via a command line interface (CLI). With this app, you can easily add expenses by category, view a summary of what has been spent in total, by category or for the week. The user interface is intuitive and easy-to-use. Overall, FastTrack aims to speed up the time taken to log expenses, saving valuable time for the user.
