### Project: HospiSearch

HospiSearch is a desktop app for healthcare administrators to manage hospital/clinic patients' particulars and is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HospiSearch can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    [\#80](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/80)
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.



* **New Feature**: Added the ability to switch between the dark and light theme.
    [\#61](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/61)
    * What it does: allows the user to choose the GUI theme he/she prefers at a specific time.
    * Justification: This feature increases the accessibility of the product because a user may not want to face strong screen light at night and don't want to look at a dark screen in the daytime.
    * Highlights: The implementation of this feature requires combined knowledge of JavaFX, CSS, and fine arts. 
    * Credit: Adapted `Theme` class from [here](https://github.com/junlong4321/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/ui/stylesheet/Stylesheet.java).



* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view patient details.
    [\#106](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/106)
    * What it does: allows the user to see detailed patient information other than the information on the small card.
    * Justification: This feature is an indispensable part of the product because the patient card in the list panel cannot contain detailed patient particulars.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is related to all commands which make modifications to the data. A view pane should also be built upon the original GUI to implement the functionality.



* **User Interface**:
    * Styled application UI with Java FX.
    * Touched up overall application layout.
    * Edited colours and restyled UI components.
    * Enabled event handler (double click) for View command.
    * Added a `Theme` toggle on the top bar.
