### Project: EduMate

EduMate is a desktop app designed for NUS students to manage their academic and social lives by lowering the barriers to meet up and make new friends within modules and school. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 30 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to organise/unorganise a meet up. (Pull requests [#228](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/pull/228), [#249](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/pull/249) )
  * What it does: allows the user to organise a customised meeting or choose a meet up recommendation generated by the `Meet` command. The user can remove any organised meetings with the `Unorganise` command.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to track and manage meet ups to keep their schedule organised.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands such as `Meet`, `Edit`, `Delete` and hence required additions to those commands.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactor UI (Pull requests [#58](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/pull/58), [#78](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/pull/78), [#178](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/pull/178), [#228](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/pull/228), [#247](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/pull/247))
    * Restructure [UI](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) to include new components such as the [scheduled meet up pane](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ScheduledMeetsListPanel.java), the [meet recommendation pane](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MeetListPanel.java), the [user profile pane](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UserProfilePanel.java) and the sidebar. 
    * Modify [help window's UI](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml) to include summary of command usage.
    * Updated the UI [colour scheme](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.css).
    * Designed [background](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/images/background.png) for side panel with Figma.
    * Replaced menu bar with sidebar and replaced `File`,`Help` options with intuitive icon buttons.
    * Modified UI to include various [visual effects](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/Extensions.css) using JavaFX and CSS, such as animated scaling, button rotation, and color changes when hovering or clicking over different components, providing users with a more dynamic and engaging experience.
