### Project: Vaccination Management System

An increasing number of vaccinations now have more complicated prerequisites to take them, and Vaccination Management System (VMS) aims to make this validation easier. **VMS is a desktop application for validating and keeping track of vaccination appointments**; its operations are **optimized for fast typists who prefer using a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Keyword
  * What it does: Keywords now have Keyword and MainKeyword attributes. Allows users to create their own mappings for `patient`, `appointment`, and `vaccination` components.
  * Highlights: 
* **New Feature**: Keyword commands
  * What it does: Allows user to 
    * add a new `Keyword` object to VMS
    * delete an existing `Keyword` object from VMS
  * Justification: Our product is used by users who type fast and work fast, hence by allowing them to create their own shortcuts for important component words, input can be shortened.
