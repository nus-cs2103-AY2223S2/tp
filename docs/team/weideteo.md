### Project: MediMate

MediMate (MM) is a cross-platform desktop application designed to help medical professionals efficiently manage patient data.
Whether you currently use paper records, electronic records, or other applications to store patient information,
MM provides an effective solution for updating, accessing, and adding new patient details easily.

MM is intended for medical professionals who possess basic computer skills, such as the ability to navigate through folders and files
on a computer, use a keyboard and mouse, open and close applications, and enter data into forms and fields.
The user interface of MM has been designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate,
accommodating users with varying levels of computer proficiency.

MM is cross-platform compatible, which means that it can be used on different operating systems such as Windows, Mac, or Linux,
allowing users to access their patient data from any device they choose.
By using MM, medical professionals can manage patient data more efficiently and effectively, which can lead to better patient outcomes.
