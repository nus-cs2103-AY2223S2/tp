### Project:NextBigFish

NextBigFish is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the command to Mark certain contacts as needing follow-up or not.
    * What it does: allows the user to mark certain contacts the user has already in NBF as needing to follow-up, or to unmark them if the contacts do not need to be followed-up. Newly added contacts are by default marked as needing follow-up.
    * Justification: This feature adds greater functionality for the user. Our target audience is people who use NBF to keep track of their business contacts, so having this feature to remind them which of their contacts require following-up on would be extremely useful.
    * Highlights: For future development, can consider *different* marking categories such as "no follow-up needed", "follow-up on: *topic* ", "finished follow-up on: *topic* ", instead of marking only need / don't need follow-up.
