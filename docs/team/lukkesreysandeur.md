### Project: Patientist - hospital management system

Patientist is a patient management system that seeks to unify data management in medical facilities.
Admin and medical staff alike will find this application useful due to the myriad of features available,
yet being fast and lightweight to use due to its optimisation for Command Line Interface (CLI) interaction.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
