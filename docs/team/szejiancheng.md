### Project: TutorPro

TutorPro is a desktop app designed to help private tutors manage their student information effectively. With TutorPro, tutors can easily keep track of their students' addresses, contact details, lessons, homework, and progress, all in one place. This app is optimised for use via a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing tutors to interact with the app using easy-to-understand buttons and menus. However, TutorPro also provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for those who prefer a faster way of getting things done. Whether you're managing a handful of students or hundreds, TutorPro can help you streamline your workflow and make your tutoring experience more efficient.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Adds the ability to track exams for a particular student.
    - What it does: Allows user to add, manipulate, and delete exams of a particular student, including details such as 
      the name of the exam, its start time, its end time, weightage, and grade.
    - Justification: This feature enables tutors to effectively track of upcoming and completed exams.
    - Highlights: This feature required additional classes for parsing and data storage that needed to be 
      implemented in order to function with the existing project structure. 
  (see [exam parsers](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/exam) and 
  [exam commands](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/exam).) 
    - Credits: @nbqian for providing the basic skeleton for similar student attributes (see lesson-related classes)
