### Project: GoodMatch

GoodMatch is a desktop application used for managing applicants and job listings for hiring managers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implement command to delete listings

    * What it does: Allows the user to delete a listing from the listing book.
    * Justification: This feature enables the user to remove listings that are expired/no longer required. 
    * Highlights: This ensures that the listing book will not be cluttered with unnecessary information and users can manage their listings more efficiently.
