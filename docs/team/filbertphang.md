### Project: RIZZipe

RIZZipe is a desktop recipe book application used for busy cooks who want to track their recipes. The user interacts
with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Code contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=filbertphang&breakdown=true)

**New Features:**
* **Find-by-property** ([\#127](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/127), [\#165](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/165))
  * What it does: Allow users to filter recipes by various criteria, e.g. recipe names, tags, or ingredients.
  * Justification: Enables users to efficiently look for recipes that they want.
  * Highlights:
    * Implemented the find-by-property feature using generics, so that any additional filter criteria in the future can be easily introduced.

**Enhancements to existing features:**
* **Refactored logic and parser for Edit, Delete, Find, Help commands** ([\#74](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/74), [\#75](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/75))
* **Refactored JSON serialization/deserialization of recipe data** ([\#86](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/86))
* **Refactored Add/Edit form** ([\#197](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/197))
  * What it does: 
    * Refactored Add/Edit forms to use the same underlying logic, instead of having separate implementations.
    * Reworked the execution of the resultant `edit` command from the Edit form to be triggered via a JavaFX event.
  * Justification: Add/Edit forms shared a lot of similar behaviour, so it was a suitable candidate for refactoring (in the spirit of DRY).
  * Credits: [James](jamesliuzx.md) for implementing the original Add/Edit forms.
* **Refactored regex parsing pipeline** ([\#245](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/245))
  * What it does: Reworked parsing process so that regex validation for `RecipeDuration` and `RecipePortion` is only done once.
  * Justifcation: Previous implementation of the parsers repeated the same regex validation at multiple stages of the parsing process, which is redundant.
* **Fixed and assisted others in fixing non-trivial UI and Logic bugs** ([\#189](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/189), [\#245](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/245), [\#257](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/257))
  * What it does: Added fixes for window resizing, error message propagation, command parsing, and recipe card highlighting for selected recipes.
  * Justification: Bug fixes improve RIZZipe's user experience
