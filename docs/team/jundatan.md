### Project: FitBook

FitBook is a desktop tracking book application used for tracking the progress and information
for the clients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added attributes and classes (eg, *Calorie*, *Appointment*(first version) and *Routine*) to client and enhanced **Add** and **Edit** Command.
  * What it does: allows the user to add and edit the recommended calorie intake, appointment and routine of the client. (Optional attribute)
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to keep track of the appointment dates and time,
    recommended calorie's intake of its clients and routine which makes it easier for the user to keep track.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added *Routine* and *Exercise* storage and model to client.
  * What it does: allows the user to make changes to Routine and exercises, and it will be stored in the exerciseroutine.json file and reflect it in the current model for FitBookExerciseRoutine.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because user gets to save their data into the storage system for future uses.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing storage to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required to add new commands and updated storage and model.

* **New Feature**: Added *WeightHistory* storage to client.
  * What it does: allows the user to make changes to WeightHistory, and it will be stored in the client's storage and reflect it in the current model for clients.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because user gets to save their client's weight history data in the storage system for future uses.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing storage to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it modifies the current client's storage and required to new commands.

* **New Feature**: Added tests for Model and Storage for Exercise Routines.
  * What it does: run automated checks for Model and Storage for Exercise Routines for this app to mitigate some bugs.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by mitigating any potential bugs.
  * Highlights: Testing has to be done on a case to case basis. Testings for storages are not simple and required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

* **New Feature**: Added different commands like (*AddRoutine and EditRoutine commands*).
  * What it does: allows the user to add or edit Exercise Routines.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because user gets to add or change the exercise routines in the storage system for future uses.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing storage to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it modifies the current client's storage and required to new commands.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jundatan&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` (1 releases) on GitHub.
  * Managed milestones and issues on GitHub.
  * Managed work assignments for team members in general.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Adding more error checks like addWeight Command where multiple weights can affect the graph.
