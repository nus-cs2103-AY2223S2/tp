MATHUTORING is a desktop application for private math tuition teachers to manage their students' contact as well as
their progress. It allows these tutors to track their studentsâ€™ progress report which subsequently allows them to plan
future lessons and have an overall view of their schedule for ease of planning.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancements added**:
  * Added task model and related commands to the original model
