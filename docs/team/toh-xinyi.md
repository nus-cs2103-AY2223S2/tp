MATHUTORING is a desktop application for private math tuition teachers to manage their students' contact as well as
their progress. It allows these tutors to track their students’ progress report which subsequently allows them to plan
future lessons and have an overall view of their schedule for ease of planning.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * [`addtask`](https://ay2223s2-cs2103-w17-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#1-adding-a-task-for-a-student-addtask)
