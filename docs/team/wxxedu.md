### Project: Wingman

Wingman is an application designed to help airline managers efficiently manage
the allocation of their resources.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contribution**:
    * My code contribution to the Wingman project can be found at
      this [link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=wxxedu&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other).

1. Adapted `AddressBook`'s model layer such that we could easily extend it.
   Including ([#21](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/21),
   [#22](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/22)):
    * Migrated `UniquePersonsList` to `UniqueList`, a list that's unique with
      the `Item`s contained inside it.
    * Migrated `ReadOnlyAddressBook` to `ReadOnlyItemManager`, an interface that
      managers the `Item`s inside it.
    * Migrated `AddressBook` to `ItemManager`.
    * **What they do**: allows my teammates to work on independent features
      without writing much duplicate code.
    * **Justification**: same as above.

2. Handled general implementation for
   Pilot ([#22](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/22))
    * Responsible for implementing the Plane model in Wingman along with all the
      basic functions related. This includes:
      adding and deleting a Plane, linking or unlinking a Plane to or from a
      Flight, and handling the storage and the
      parsing of a Plane.

    * **What it does:** Allows for a Plane to be properly managed in the Wingman
      app.
    * **Justification:** It includes all the necessary commands which a manager
      would need to manage the planes in their
      fleet eg. they can add a new plane, and delete planes which are out of
      service.

3. Rewrote the parser for Wingman, abandoning the original parsing logic.
   ([#39](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/39))
    * Adopted a 2-level parsing scheme that can be adapted to a multi-level
      parsing scheme easily.
    * **What it does**: parses the command put into Wingman.
    * **Justification**: to reduce the boilerplate in the original AddressBook
      parser and make the parser more suitable to a modal design.

4. Implemented a `Link` class that represents a link between two entities.
    * **What it does**: describes a link from one entity to another.
    * **Justification**: reduce code duplication (did not work so well).

5. Added unit tests for most of the core refactorings that I did.
    * **What it does**: ensures that the refactoring is done correctly.
    * **Justification**: to ensure that the refactoring is done correctly.

There are also many miscellaneous things that I did, but compared to the
ones list above, they are relatively minor. Hence, I will not list them there.

* **Project Management**:
    * Joined in discussions about where the project is going.
    * Reviewed several pull requests and gave feedback to my teammates.

* **Documentation**:
    * Updated the User Guide to discuss the underlying logic for the
      new parser that I wrote.
    * Miscellaneous documentation updates.
