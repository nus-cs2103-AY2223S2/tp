#ModTrek
### Overview:
ModTrek is a desktop application for managing a typical NUS Computer Science student’s modules and degree progression, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). We envision the app to be convenient so that students can easily access and update their modules within presses of a keyboard.
