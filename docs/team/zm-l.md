### Project: InternEase

InternEase is a **powerful and innovative desktop app designed to streamline the internship application process** for **Computer Science undergraduates**. With its optimized **combination of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, InternEase offers users the best of both worlds - the speed and efficiency of a CLI for those who can type quickly, and the user-friendly experience of a GUI for those who prefer a visual interface. InternEase is a good choice for you who wants to concentrate on your internship preparation by helping to manage your internship applications' data.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
