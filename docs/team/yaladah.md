I’m a Y2 CS student. I’m from Singapore and I enjoy getting in calls with friends and playing casual games.

## Pied Piper

I took part in developing Pied Piper, a task management app that helps current and future university student
leaders take charge of their group projects. It allows students to more easily manage their group project, 
and keep track of their teammates' progress while being able to rate their performances upon completion of
their assigned tasks.

### Contributions to the project

* **New Feature**: Added command to edit tasks.
  * What it does: Allows user to change the parameters of the task input.
  * Why: If the user makes a mistake, instead of deleting and creating a new one, can easily 
  edit the fields of the existing task.
  * Highlights: It provides extra flexibility for the user to change the type of tasks, as well as different type parameters due to constantly changing project management conditions.
  * Pull requests: [\#91](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/91)
* **New Feature**: Added command to delete tasks.
  * What it does: Allows user to completely remove a task.
  * Why: So the user can remove outdated or unwanted tasks.
  * Highlights: The trusty delete function for any instance of task that is created. The app would be too cluttered if tasks were not deletable, and this is a simple but big quality of life change.
