### Project: Wingman

Wingman is an application designed to help airline managers efficiently manage the allocation of their resources.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Feature 1**: Crew mode-related commands, including `add`, `delete`
  , `list` ([#58](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/58))
    * What it does: Allows the user to add, delete, and display current crew members in the database. The rank of a crew
      can also be specified using prefixes.
    * Justification: It includes all the essential commands to manage the crew for a flight.


* **Feature 2**: Scrollable panels for all modes ([#128](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/128))
    * What it does: Displays 5 scrollable panels for each mode (Flight, Crew, Pilot, Plane and Location)
    * Justification: All information can be displayed in one window without having to switch between modes, which saves
      time for the users.


* **Feature 3**: Responsive Status Bar Footer ([#74](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/74))
    * What it does: Shows the current mode the user is in.
    * Justification: The commands are mode-specific so a status bar footer displaying the current mode would help a user
      use the correct command.


* **Feature 4**: Display index for each item in the
  panel ([#131](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/131))
    * What it does: Shows the index for each flight, crew, pilot, plane and location item.
    * Justification: A displayed index helps the user pick the correct item to delete and link, without having to type
      out its uuid which is time-consuming.
