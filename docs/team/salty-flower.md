### Project: ConnectUS

ConnectUS is the ultimate contact management application for NUS School of Computing students.
It is a CLI-based cross-platform desktop application that allows you to maintain a record of your contacts.
Your burden of remembering the details of each person is now lifted.
With ConnectUS in hand, nothing can stop you from socializing with your peers.

to see my overall contribution to the project!

For a deeper breakdown, please refer to the following sections ;)

##### :sparkles:**New Feature**: Added support for social media platforms.
###### What it does
Allows the user to associate social media accounts with their contacts
and utilize these to contact them directly from ConnectUS.

Instagram, Telegram and WhatsApp have been supported.
For WhatsApp, users can even compose their text inside the app and launch the messenger with the text pre-filled.
Only one extra keystroke of `Enter` is required to actually send out the message.

###### Justification
NUS students now use social media platforms on a day-to-day basis;
how should we stick with the old-fashioned phone-centric address book?!
This feature allows them
to contact their contacts directly from the app
without having to open their browser or messenger app and search for the contact again and again.

###### :sparkles:**New Feature**: Added command to directly add/delete tags.
###### What it does
Allows the user to directly add or delete any kind of tags
(remark, CCA, module, major, everything!)
from a contact instead of editing the entire contact.

###### Justification
Imagine you have carefully fine-tuned your contact list and have accreted dozens of tags.
Then you suddenly spot a typo in one of them!
OMG - you have to edit the entire contact just to fix that one typo!
Now this feature comes in to your handy rescue~
You just delete the tag and add it again with the correct spelling.
Hooray!
What a lifesaver.

##### :recycle:**DevOps**: Keep building command in order
###### What it does
Changes the gradle package `mainClassName` so that `shadowrun` executes without any hassle.
Downgrades JavaFX version to `11` so that no more warning messages are thrown.

###### Justification
This is a warm change that makes the development process much more convenient
even if it is not a feature that is directly visible to the user.

##### :memo:**Documentation**: Updated User Guide and Developer Guide to reflect the new features
###### What it does
Updates the User Guide on further details of social media features and tag commands.
Provided PlantUML sequence diagrams and activity diagrams for these new features.
