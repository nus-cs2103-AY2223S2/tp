## Project: TechTrack

{{ site.data.techtrack.about.summary }}

For me, i worked on the backend component and fixing bugs. In addition, i worked on the various documentations, UG, DG and "About Us" page.

## Contributions
* **New Feature**: Add field `Website` to `add` command
    * What it does: Allows the company website to be added by the user.
    * Justification: Many Companies have their own website and the user might want to store the website in the role. This will allow to user to refer to the role card and use the website to apply for the job.
    * Highlights: 
      * Example website: Company of Google (www.google.com) Command: `w/www.google.com`
      * It was challenging at the start to find how the AB3 program works, as i needed to figure out which files to refactor and change.
      * Needed to refactor and edit the command parser files, add command etc.
      

* **New Feature**: Sort roles based on deadline 
    * What it does: Allows the user to sort the deadline of role application by ascending or descending order.
    * Justification: Users might forget the deadline for the application of the job, hence can sort by the deadline to show the most recent deadline or least recent dateline.
    * Highlights: 
      * Using the command `deadline asc`, shows the nearest application that the user should apply.
      * Role can be easily sorted for the user's convenience as applying jobs is a time-sensitive task.
      * Check to make sure date is of the correct format and that it is not an invalid date (passed or does not exist).


* **Enhancements to existing features**: 
    * Refactored the `Address` classes and methods to the `Role`, e.g. AddressBook to RoleBook .
      * What it does: The package is changed accordingly to the needs of the application.
      * Justification: Roles fits towards TechTrack instead of address and would be clearer for future developments.
      * Highlights: Refactored AB3 code and tests.
    * Set Deadline to only allow current date and after current date.
    * Set Website field to be www. + any amount of characters + .com.


* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added my own commands and set up table of commands.
        * `w/www.google` field and `deadline asc` command.
        * Added UI Images to each command.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added Sequence diagram and Commit Activity Diagram for `Deadline` Command.
        * Added Sequence diagram, description  for `add` and `edit` Command.
        * Added documentation for `add` and `edit` manual testing appendix.
        * Added NFR section of requirement details.
        * Adjusted and ensure proper formatting of guide.
        

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
    * Created priority and type tags in team repository.
    * Set Goals and deadline to complete certain tasks; Finish feature 1 by 20-03-2023 etc.
    * Created and Managed Milestones for 1.2,1.3.
    * Bug Fixes
        * Fixed UG bugs, where commands descriptions are not stated clearly.
        * Fixed UG bug where error message is not shown.
        * Fixed sorting bug, where original list is deleted after filtered.
        * Fixed Bugs in the UI (Wrong display format)
