### Project: Patientist - hospital management system

Patientist is a patient management system that aims to streamline data management in medical facilities such as Hospitals.
The app is fast and lightweight to use due to its optimisation for Command Line Interface (CLI) interaction, while
providing many features tailored to Medical Staffs.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `view`, a command to view details of a selected person.
  * Added a UI component to show the details to view.
    * Added a new UI region beside the existing person list panel.
  * Allows the user to view details in every field of a person.
  * This feature enables the users to view more content that is not shown in the person card list.

* **New Feature**: Added a priority tag field to `Patient`.
  * Displays severity of a patient in either HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme
