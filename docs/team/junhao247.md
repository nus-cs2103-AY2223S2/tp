## Overview

***ExecutivePro*** is a desktop app for Human Resource managers to manage their employee information,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EP can get your employee management tasks done **faster** than traditional GUI apps.

ExecutivePro is a project adapted from AddressBook - Level 3.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### <u> Code Contributed </u>

* [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=junhao247&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

#### <u> Enhancements Implemented </u>
* **New Features**
  * Implemented `batchadd` feature.
    * Created a `BatchAddCommand` class to handle the logic
      and `BatchAddCommandParser` class to handle the parsing of the user input.
    * Use Case: User can add multiple employees at once if they have the data in the form of a `.csv` file.
    * Why: Users will have to manually input each employee using an add command without this command. Hence, with
      this command, users get to transfer their current database into our database,
      allowing for a seamless transition.
    * Constraints: This implementation was rather difficult as it was rather different from all other commands
      which were implemented before. Moreover, having to read from an external file,
      especially when `.csv` file is involved, making it difficult to test.

  * Implemented `batchexport` feature.
    * Created a `BatchExportCommand` class to handle the logic
      and `BatchExportCommandParser` class to handle the parsing of the user input.
    * Use Case: User can export the database in the form of a `.csv` file into the `data` folder.
    * Why: Users get to export the database into a file in order to print out the current records for employees.
    * Constraints: This implementation was difficult because I had to ensure that the formats remain the same
      and is not affected by external files.
    
  * Wrote test cases for `BatchAddCommand` and `BatchExportCommand`.
  * Wrote javadocs for `AddCommand`, `BatchAddCommand`, `BatchExportCommand` and `ClearCommand`.

  * `batchadd` command.

#### <u> Contributions to the team-based tasks </u>
* Coordinated the weekly meetings and ensure that agenda is being met.
* Keep track of tasks to be done by team members for weekly objectives.
* Helped to create and distribute issues.
