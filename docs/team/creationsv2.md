### Project: HospiSearch

HospiSearch is a desktop app for healthcare administrators to manage hospital/clinic patients' particulars and optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HospiSearch can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `nric` field in patient records. [#45](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/45)
    * What it does: Allows users to store `nric` of patients and uniquely identify them by `nric`.
    * Justification: This feature allows for easy unqiue identification of a patient.
  Previously uniqueness was checked by the `name` field, which is not ideal as two patients may have the same name.
    * Highlights: To prevent incorrect formats, the `nric` field is only able to take in `nric`s with valid
                  formats.


* **New Feature**: Added ability to filter by `tag` fields.
  [#86](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/86)
    * What it does: Allows users to be filtered by their current `tag`s.
    * Justification: This feature allows for easy filtering of patients by their conditions, represented by `tag`s.


* **New Feature**: Added `doctor` field in patient records.
[#121](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/121)
    * What it does: Allows users to be tagged to an attending `doctor`.
    * Justification: This feature allows for easy identification of patients by current attending `doctor`.
    * Highlights: Attending `doctor` is now shown beside each patient for quick relational view.


* **New Feature**: Added ability to filter by attending `doctor` field.
[#123](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/123)
    * What it does: Allows users to be filtered by their current attending `doctor`.
