### Project: AutoM8

AutoM8 is a **desktop app for an auto repair shop, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AutoM8 can get your auto repair shop management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**: Implemented ListXCommands.
  * What it does: Displays the entire list of `Customers`, `Vehicles`, `Services`, `Appointments`, `Technicians` and `Parts` in the app along with their IDs and information overview in the list cards.
  * Justification: This feature provides users with a simple and efficient way to view all available elements in the app. It reduces the time and effort required to navigate the app and search for specific elements.
  * Highlights: The ListXCommands feature enhances the app's usability and accessibility by allowing users to view all available elements in one place.

* **New Feature Enhancements**: Added GUI integrations/behaviours for all features in the app
  * Justification: The addition of GUI integrations/behaviors is an obvious need for users to use/interact with all the functions we implemented for the AutoM8 application. By incorporating graphical user interface elements that align with the underlying command logic, we can provide users with a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, allowing them to easily access and utilize all features of the app.
  * Highlights: The new and enhanced GUI integrations/behaviors allow for a more seamless and efficient user experience, with all features accessible through a unified interface.

* **New Feature**: Assisted with implementing ViewX
  * What it does: Allows the user to view more information about X where X is for example Customer, Technician, Parts etc.
  * Justification: AutoM8 has listX to show the names of items and their related ID. Showing all information from list may be crowded, so list is to see the general ID and name, whereas view shows the complete information of that particular item.

* **New Feature**: Added a Date Status for Appointments that is based on current date time
  * What it does: Allows the user to know whether their appointments with customers are NOW, UPCOMING or PASSED based on the current date the user opened the app
  * Justification: Enhances user experience and improves scheduling efficiency by providing an easy and intuitive way to prioritize appointments.
  * Highlights: The UI has tags which are color coded and represent the date statuses: NOW, UPCOMING or PASSED. I also added a sort that sorts the appointments by date statuses by default for users to easily see the important appointments.
