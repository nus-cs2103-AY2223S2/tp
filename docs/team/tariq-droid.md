### Project: Contact nUS

coNtactUS is a module tracker created specially for NUS computing students, by NUS computing students. It is optimised for use via typing instead of clicking, which has been shown to be faster. This helps NUS computing students to be more efficient in their work. Developed by a team of NUS computing students who are familiar with the problems that computing students face on a daily basis, coNtactUS is here to make module tracking an effortless process.

#### Contributions Summary

coNtactUS is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. The development team consists of 4 members, including myself. Given below are some of my contributions to the project.

1. New Feature: Added the reminder feature. [\#70](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/70) [\#143](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/143)
  * What it does: allows the user see all of his work for the day. This includes all timeslots and deadlines for the day based on the system's date
