### Project: PowerCards

PowerCards enable university students to input a pool of information (question-answer pairs) of their desired topic and utilize the application to practice active recall of this information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Created and styled initial UI components [#98](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/98)
    * What it does: Changed the layout and styling of the default AB3 with new components so that the app can function according to how we intended it to.
    * Justification: With the ability to create new UI components, our team can have more flexibility to design a much more fleshed out app.
    * Highlights: Studying the fxml files and Theme.css to find out how they link to the UI components to allow us to change them according to our needs
* **New Feature**: Added stats UI [#191](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/191)
  * What it does: Displays the deck statistics when a user starts a review (deck title, cards left, score etc)
  * Justification: With these statistics, reviewing a deck is now more clear and the user would know how to navigate the review and know the details of the deck being reviewed.
  * Highlights: Reworking existing UI features for a consistent style.
