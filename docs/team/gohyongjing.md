### Project: FriendlyLink

FriendlyLink is a personnel information management tool designed for Voluntary Welfare Organisations to keep elderly and volunteer records, and pair them up efficiently and effectively.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to pair up elderly and volunteers.
    * What it does: Allows elderly to be paired up with volunteers in the system
    * Justification: This feature allows the administrative staff to pair up elderly and volunteers so that they can take care of assigned elderly and keep them company.
    * Highlights: This feature checks if the members to be paired exists in FriendlyLink, and also prevents duplicate records from being added.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to see summary statistics.
  * What it does: Allows users to see summary statistics 
  * Justification: This feature allows the administrative staff to make sure each elderly member is taken care of and that the workload of volunteers is allocated evenly, recruiting more volunteers if required
  * Highlights: This feature is versatile and can be used with the `find` command to see statistics on a filtered list (E.g. See total number of volunteers in the north, or total number of elderly with high risk levels.)

    1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed in your Computer.

    1. Download the latest `friendlylink.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/releases).

    1. Move the `friendlylink.jar` to an empty folder where you want FriendlyLink to store information.

    1. Double-click on the `friendlylink.jar` file. If the app does not open, follow the following steps instead.
        * Open a terminal
            * On **Windows**: Click Start and search for `Command Prompt`
            * On **macOS**: Open Launchpad and search for `terminal`
        * Move into the folder you are keeping FriendlyLink by entering `cd FILE/PATH/TO/FRIENDLYLINK` into the terminal
        * Open the app by entering `java -jar friendlylink.jar` into the terminal.


* **Extracts from developer guide**

    The `stats` command displays summary statistics about FriendlyLink, such as the total number of elderly, volunteers and unpaired persons.

    It is implemented using the `Summary` and `AggregateFunction` class.

    The `AggregateFunction`
    * describes a particular statistic of FriendlyLink with a number.
    * is an abstract class that requires concrete classes to override the `getDescription()` and `getResult()` method.

    The `Summary` object
    * formats the results to be displayed to the user.
    * takes in 0 or more `AggregateFunction`s to show their description and results.
