### Project: CLIpboard
CLIpboard is a desktop application that helps educators, especially those that tutor multiple classes, by managing their studentsâ€™ particulars in an organised manner.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
