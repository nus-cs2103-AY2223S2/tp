### Overview
BookFace is an NUS-centered contacts management system that allows students of NUS to organise their list of friends and acquaintances that they have met in their various classes, CCAs, project groups etc. The application aims to provide NUS students a means to keep track of the contact details of the numerous people they have met during their time in NUS in hopes of facilitating better communication among peers, as well as provide a centralised channel for students to obtain relevant administrative contact information of the various departments and faculties that are in the school.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=pkpaing&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

**Features implemented**

* **New Feature**: `import`
* What it does: Import staff contacts for relevant faculties. 'staff' can refer to any person in the teaching, administrative or management teams in the faculty.
* Justification: As the target audience for the application is NUS students, it would be of great help if they were able to import the default contacts for their respective faculties, to help them get familiar with these contacts.
