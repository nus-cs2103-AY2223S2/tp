### Project: Army Information Management System

Army Information Management System is a desktop address book application built to handle the personal information of
military personnel. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Code contributed
  **: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jugheadjones10&breakdown=true)
- **Enhancements implemented**:
    - Added new fields to the application: Rank, Unit, Platoon, and Company. This was done to enable the app to
      be used in an army context where such information is relevant.
    - Added a favorites feature to the app, enabling users to "pin" favorited contacts to a favorites sidebar.

- **Contributions to the UG**:
    - Contributed addition of the new fields: Rank, Unit, Platoon, and Company to places where all the fields are
      listed.
    - Contributed explanation on how to use the favorites feature.
