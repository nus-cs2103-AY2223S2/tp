### Project: MyLib

MyLib is a desktop bookmarking application used for keeping track of books a user is reading. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense hyperlink](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=wong-jia-jun&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17)

* **New Feature**: Added GoTo command functionality. This involves opening url of bookmark in user's default browser [#135](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/135/files), [#184](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/184)
    * What it does: Opens url of a bookmark in user's browser
    * Justification: This provides convenience to the user instead of having to copy the url field and pasting after opening a browser

* **New Feature**: Added the View Command functionality [#176](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/176/files)
    * What it does: Allows the user to view specifics of a bookmark more clearly in a separate panel
    * Justification: This feature allows users to see more clearly each field of the bookmark as well as longer fields like url which is not present in bookmark on left panel since it may be quite long

* **Enhancements**:
    * Revamp GUI and add on-click support for some commands [#80](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/80), [#99](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/99/files), [#153](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/153/files), [#160](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/160/files)
