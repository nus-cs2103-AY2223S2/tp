### Project: Vaccination Management System

An increasing number of vaccinations now have more complicated prerequisites to take them, and Vaccination Management System (VMS) aims to make this validation easier. **VMS is a desktop application for validating and keeping track of vaccination appointments**; its operations are **optimized for fast typists who prefer using a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project

* **New Feature**:
  * Added `vaccination` feature.
    * CRUD features.
    * Clear feature.
    * Patient eligibility validation feature.
    * Find feature.
    * Sample vaccination data.

* **Enhancement to existing features**:
  * Enhanced message presentation of application.
    * Colorize messages based on severity.
    * Allow past messages to be seen.
  * Separate GUI and application processes into different threads.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=daitenshionyan&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
