### Project: Fish Ahoy!

*Fish Ahoy!* Is a **desktop app for managing your fish, fish tanks, and relevant tasks, optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br>

*Fish Ahoy!* **streamlines** the fish keeping experience by helping you keep track of your many **fishes**, **tanks** and
**weekly tasks**, such as feeding and cleaning.

Given below are my major contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view the fishes in a tank and tasks associated with it
  * What it does: allows the user to see just the fishes that are in a specified tank
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view the fishes in a tank without having to scroll through the entire list of fishes and having to manually sort by tank in their head.


* **New Feature**: Ability to list all fishes
  * What it does: allows to user to see all the fishes across all of their tanks
  * Justification: This feature was needed in conjunction with the previous one to allow the user to see all the fishes in their tanks.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=diamondroxxx&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false)


* **Project management**:
  * Set up the initial repo and team on GitHub with all of the required CIs.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:

I was in charge of designing and implementing the user interface. I used JavaFX to create the GUI and used CSS to style the GUI. 
As such I had to redesign the Tank and Fish cards to fit the new GUI design. I also had to create Task cards from scratch. 

Shown below are the starting UI and the final UI respectively.

![New UI](../images/Ui.png)

Working on the UI was challenging for me as most of my experience before this was with purely CLI applications.
I got a good chance to learn about JavaFX and CSS and how to use them to create a GUI. I also had to look up a lot of
UI design principles to make sure that the UI was intuitive and easy to use. There was also a lot of tweaking and trial and error required to make things look good.

I am most proud of the Tank Readings graphs as I think they present the required information in a clean and intuitive manner.
In the future, I would like to learn more about UI design so that I can show more information in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming.
In this current version of the UI I had to make certain compromises on the amount of information displayed to keep everything clean.


* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added FAQ section and small tweaks to add fish-keeping specific terminology.
    * Fixed some typos and formatting issues.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added the implementation of the `UI` component.
