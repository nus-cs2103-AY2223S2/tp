### Project: PowerCards

PowerCards enable university students to input a pool of information (question-answer pairs) of their desired topic and utilize the application to practice active recall of this information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Design and implement styling of the overall UI on Figma - Main and Review mode screens and PowerCards Logo (PR [#162](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/162) [#181](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/181) [#183](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/183) [#187](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/187))

*Initial prototype design of PowerCards UI.*

  * What it does: Allows users to navigate the app intuitively and enjoy the user experience.
  * Justification: The UI of a flashcard application is a key component of usability and attractiveness of the product.
  * Highlights: The user flows of first creating decks then cards were considered in the creation of the 2 panel (one for deck, one for cards) interface. 

  * **New Feature**: Review Mode and the related commands - Start/End Review, Flip, Next, Previous, and Tag Difficulty (PRs [#73](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/73) [#99](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/99) [#128](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/128) [#147](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/147) [#162](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/162) [#178](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/178) [#179](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/179) [#181](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/181) [#183](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/183) [#231](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/231) [#236](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/236)
      * What it does: Allows users to review the all cards in a deck or optionally review cards by the difficulty tagged.
      * Justification: It enables users to test their knowledge on the decks which is a vital purpose of PowerCards
      * Highlights: The user experience of the CLI was a great priority - hence the keys for the commands were selected to be all in close proximity to each other and the 'Enter' key, enabling users to do fast, one-handed operations in the review mode.
