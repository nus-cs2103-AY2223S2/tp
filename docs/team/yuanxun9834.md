### Project: PetPal

PetPal is your **furry and dependable assistant** who **reminds you of deadlines** and **consolidates crucial information** like pet names, tags dietary needs all in an **aesthetically pleasing** GUI! The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Remind/Deadline Feature**: Added the ability to add deadlines for pets.
  * Justification: Users have many pets to manage and might forget important tasks due for certain pets.
  * Highlights: Deadlines that are due soon are highlighted in the GUI and the user is reminded of them.
  * PRs : [#44](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/44), [#45](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/45)
  * Credits:
    * Remind and deadline function was inspired by my ip project, which was a to-do list app.
* **Change Cost Feature**: Added the ability to change the cost calculation of a pet.
  * Justification: Certain species of pets may incur a different cost than the default cost.
  * Highlights: Deadlines that are due soon are highlighted in the GUI and the user is reminded of them.
