### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)

Enhance life with WIFE! Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment &lt;WIFE/&gt; helps users to manage their food items in the fridge. With this, one never have to worry about optimizing storage and organization of food items in their refrigerator

Given below are my contributions to the project.

-   **New Feature**: Modify create tag to take in multiple tag names.

    -   What it does: allows the user to create multiple tags with 1 command line.
    -   Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user will now be able to create multiple tags with one command line without having to type `createtag` multiple times.

-   **New Feature**: Added the ability to list food list by specified tags.

    -   What it does: allows the user to list food by specified tags.
    -   Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user will now be able to focus on food they are interested in. This way if the user were to tag their food with their name, they can easily list food by their name to give them a personalised experience in managing their food even in communal living.

-   **New Feature**: Added the ability to Delete food list by specified tags.

    -   What it does: allows the user to delete food by specified tags.
    -   Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user will now be able to delete multiple food based on their tag. This way if the user were to remove food from the fridge with a specific tag, the user can easily delete all of them at once with the tag.
        Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in future. This feature will be useful for future feature where WIFE will automatically tag food that are expired with an "expired" tag. With this feature, user can easily delete all food by the expired tag.

-   **New Feature**: Added the ability to Delete specified tag.

    -   What it does: allows the user to delete specified tags in the WIFE.
    -   Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user will now be able to remove all specifieds tags in the WIFE and all occurrences of the food items in the food list.
