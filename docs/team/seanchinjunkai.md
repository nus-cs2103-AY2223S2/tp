### Project: HospiSearch

HospiSearch is a desktop app for healthcare administrators to manage hospital/clinic patients' particulars and optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HospiSearch can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contributed** : [Code dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=SeanChinJunKai&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)


* **New Feature** : Delete patient records by their unique identifier, NRIC [\#49](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/49), [\#62](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/62), [\#115](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/115)
    * What it does: Allows healthcare administrators to delete patient records from the system by NRIC.
    * Justification: This allows the healthcare administrators to remove patient records which are no longer needed. One such example could be that after a patient has died and the required retention period has passed, the records can be deleted to free up memory in the system.


* **New Feature** : Implemented the logic for `view` command. [\#90](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/90)
    * What it does: Allows healthcare administrators to view in-depth patient information.
    * Justification: Since a patient has many details to keep track of, we are unable to show everything in the patient records list.


* **New User field** : Drug allergies [\#81](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/81)
    * What it does: Allows healthcare administrators to take note of patients' drug allergies during registration or updating of medical information.
    * Justification: This allows the drug allergy information to be present so that doctors can prescribe the correct medication to the patients.


* **Project management** :
    * Created tags for issue triaging.
    * Reviewed and approved PRs for merging.
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial comments): [\#71](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/71)
    * Created a total of [5](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3ASeanChinJunKai+) issues for GitHub issue tracker.
