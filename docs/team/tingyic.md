# coNtactUS

## Overview

Welcome to **Chew Ting Yi's** personal **Project Portfolio Page**!

**coNtactUS** is a **module tracker** created specially for ***NUS computing students***, by ***NUS computing
students***. It is optimised for use via typing instead of clicking, which has been shown to be faster. This helps
***NUS computing students*** to be **more efficient in their work**. Developed by a team of ***NUS computing students***
who are familiar with the problems that the students face on a daily basis, **coNtactUS** is here to **make module
tracking an effortless process**.

### My contribution to the project

coNtactUS is written in **Java**. The development team consists of 4 intermediate student developers, including myself. 
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Feature and enhancements

* **New feature**: Added the ability for users to enter `teacher` to a module in the module tracker.
[#33](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/33)
  * What it does: allows users to add a `teacher` to a module. E.g: the `teacher` can be `Prof Damith`, `Mr. bean`, etc.
  * Justification: Just like there are a lot of Computing _students_, there are also a lot of Computing _professors_ and
  _Teaching Assistants (TAs)_, each with their own lecture and/or tutorial slots. With the addition of this feature,
  Computing students can **keep track their own professors or TAs** for their modules, allowing them to know who to
  contact when facing difficulties in their studies or well-being more easily.

* **New feature**: Added the ability for users to enter `resource` to a module in the module tracker.
[#66](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/66)
  * What it does: allows users to add `resource` to a module. E.g: the `resource` can be `https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/`,
  `https://outlook.office.com/mail/`, etc.
  * Justification: As Computing students, many of the modules have different website (LumiNUS, Canvas, Google Drive,
  OneDrive, Coursemology, etc.), and it is just tedious to memorise every last one. With the implementation of this
  feature, students can **keep track of their module websites and additional resources** without having to trouble
  others when they forget which websites to refer to.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactored `AddressBook` and its equivalents to either `Contact nUS` or `ModuleTracker` and their respective
    equivalents. [#83](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/83)
  * Fixed the bug omitted by teammates unintentionally that incorrectly uses the error message for `timeslot` for
  user input error in `deadline`. [#86](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/86)
 

#### Additional code contributions

[#150](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/150)

* Fixed JavaCI failures. [#152](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/152)

* Improve code quality according to the guidelines of KISS and SLAP.

* Utilitises assertions to ease the debugging process.
