### Project: Contact nUS

Contact nUS is a desktop **module tracker application** used for **students** to keep track of their **NUS modular
components.** The user interacts with it using a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, while still having the benefits of a
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)** created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
