### Project: InternBuddy

InternBuddy provides a 1-stop platform for Computing undergraduates to manage and track their internship applications. It is optimized for typing which Computing undergraduates are comfortable and proficient in, allowing them to fully and efficiently exploit the applicationâ€™s organisational capabilities.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=seadragon2000341&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**: Added `upcoming` command [#93](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/93)
  * What it does: Allows users to find internships that have upcoming events (interviews/assessments) or deadlines (application/acceptance deadline).
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because it provides a busy user with a convenient way to check his internship application schedule for the week.
  

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
