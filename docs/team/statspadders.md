### Project: MODcheck

MODcheck is a desktop app to allow students to easily check the module coordinators, professors and teaching
assistants in the modules they are taking.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Add Command
    * What it does: Allow users to add a new field MODULE_TAGS
    * Justification: This new field would help users keep track of module-specific tags or could be used to further differentiate between individuals or groups involved in the same module. The added benefit of having module tags in a vibrant orange color can also make the user interface more vibrant and visually appealing which further helps to organise ModCheck.
    * Highlights: It is a bit tedious since you must perform a thorough analysis of the add command and know where to make further improvements to the existing code.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Add Command
    * What it does: Keeping the field NAME as the primary requirement, and remove the mandatory requirement of all other fields.
    * Justification: In our daily lives, it is difficult to have complete contact information for individuals. It is a poor idea if ModCheck prevents someone from adding a person's contact information because he is lacking a required field.
    * Highlights: Understanding how AB3 enforces mandatory fields, and uses regex to validate parameters. It was difficult to learn and apply the new regex. 
    * Credits: @joellow88 for suggesting this issue.

* **New Feature**: Light/Dark Mode
    * What it does: Allow the users to change between light or dark mode
    * Justification: ModCheck adopts the AB3 (Dark theme) basic user interface, which may be a little dull. As a result, a light theme is available for users who like to use the program in a light tone.
    * Highlights: Updating the CSS was difficult because there were extra fields in the css theme file from AB3 that were not utilized in AB3, making it difficult to identify the fields that you wanted to alter.
