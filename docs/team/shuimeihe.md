### Project: PetPal

PetPal is a desktop pet management application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and information is displayed on a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

The main target users for PetPal are pet daycare owners who have a large pet clientele to manage and provides
an open-source, free-to-use application for them to do so.

PetPal can also be scaled to target users such as pet shelters, pet shops, pet walkers and more
