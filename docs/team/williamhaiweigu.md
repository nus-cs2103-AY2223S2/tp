# Overview:

Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for managing teaching assistant activities, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
TAA can get your teaching assistant tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
