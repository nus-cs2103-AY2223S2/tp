### Project: FAid

FAid is designed for users who work as financial advisors and provides a platform for them to manage contacts, addresses, financial needs and plans of the clients, as well as meetings with clients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to automatically detect the region of addresses
    * FAid automatically assigns a region to an address when a new person is added.
    * Having additional information about a client's physical region can be very helpful if our user wishes to physically meet with the client and want to minimise time spent travelling.
* **New UI**: Added an additional meeting panel to the UI and changed the color theme
    * Implemented the backend for the new meeting panel to communicate with the addressbook data
    * Changed FAid from a dark theme to a light blue theme

* **Code Constributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=W12-3&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=bokung&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
