### Project: Mycelium

**Mycelium** is a desktop application aimed at helping **freelance web developers
manage clients and projects** from multiple online sources like [Upstack](https://upstackhq.com/),
[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), and [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/). All interactions
with **Mycelium** are done through text commands or HotKeys, enabling one to efficiently
manipulate data while availing oneself to the convenience of viewing, offered by the
Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java.

Below are my contributions to the project:

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=RubyNguyen07&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false).

* **Enhancements implemented**: I implemented the Statistics dashboard which provides users insights on
the due soon projects, overdue projects and progress overview based on project status. I also made enhancements
on the GUI including positioning and styling main UI components.

* **Testing**: I am responsible for testing the Statistics dashboard's related methods along with the GUI (with the
GUI testing structure based on [Address book-level4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4)).

* **Project management**: I helped set up the Issue Tracker and planned some of the weekly meeting's agenda.

* **Documentation**:
    * **Contributions to UG**: I am responsible for writing up the documentation about Glossary, Statistics Panel, and
  Command summary.
    * **Contributions to DG**: I am responsible for writing up the documentation about User Interface, Testing and the Appendix: Planned 
  Enhancements section for Long strings are cut off and Pie chart for project status spins even when no statuses change.

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**: I was responsible for setting up the team's repository and the UserGuide.
