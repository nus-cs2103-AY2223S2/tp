### Project: ExpressLibrary

ExpressLibrary is a desktop application used for librarians to easily track the status of books in the library. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Modified the book object in ExpressLibrary so that it is not only a field in `Person` class and added `ListBookCommand`.
  * What it does: allows the user to list all books in
    ExpressLibrary.
  * Justification: This feature is essential for ExpressLibrary to function properly because the `Book` object is a very vital component of ExpressLibrary that would break exisitng and new commands if not implemented properly.
  * Highlights: This was very challenging as it required to all four components in ExpressLibrary in order to work. For `UI`, the GUI had to be reworked in order to accomodate the new book list. For `Logic`, commands had to acoomodate the new book object. `Model` is self explantory and for `Storage` reading and writing the new book object.

* **New Feature**: Added colour coding for due dates when the book is about to expire/expiring.
  * What it does: alerts the user about the books that are going to expire by changing the colour of due dates so that the user can remind the borrowers to return their books.
  * Justification: This feature is a nice-to-have for ExpressLibrary as it provides users with instant visual feedback about what books to prioritise.
  * Highlights: It was interesting to find out how CSS works differently with JavaFX and coming up with alternative implementations to solve this problem.
