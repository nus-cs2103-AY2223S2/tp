### Project: Advis.io

Advis.io (AIO) is a all-in-one solution for financial advisors with problems managing their clientele. AIO is currently
available on PC, and is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of having a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to select client
    * What it does: Allows the user to select a client and display his or her information with their relevant policies
      on the UI panel.
    * Justification: It is neater to be able to view the specific client information that you are interested in only.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects all other commands and is the core mechanism for navigating around Advis.io.
* **New Feature**: Client Label on GUI
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the details of the selected client.
    * Justification: It removes clutter from the client list and enables the user to focus on one client at a time.
* **New Feature**: Appointment Label on GUI
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the next appointment coming up for the selected client.
    * Justification: It helps the user keep track on their progress with the selected client.
* **New Feature**: Policy List Panel on GUI
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the policies subscribed to by a client.
    * Justification: This feature enables the visualization and organization of policies in Advis.io.
