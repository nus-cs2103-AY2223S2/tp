### Project: Adviso.io

Advis.io (AIO) is a all-in-one solution for financial advisors with problems managing their clientele. AIO is currently available on PC, and is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to select client
  * What it does: allows the user to select a client and display his or her information with their relevant policies on the UI panel.
  * Justification: It is neater to be able to view the specific client information that you are interested in only.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tituswe&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
