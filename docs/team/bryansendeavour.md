### Project: Paidlancers

Paidlancers is a desktop app designed to help freelancers streamline their event management tasks. It is the brainchild me and my team, who wanted to simplify and automate the administrative side of freelancing.

The app is optimized for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Some of its features include adding and linking contacts to events, tracking rates, marking events as done, creating new events, viewing event lists and revenue, and more.

By centralizing all event-related information and tasks in one place, Paidlancers aims to increase productivity and help freelancers focus on their craft.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * `newcontact` Added ability for users to create as well as store a contact in the contact list. (Pull Request [#78](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/78))
    * What it does: Allows user to add a contact to the contact list.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of all the contacts in the contact list. This is useful for users who just want to search for the contact.
    * Highlights: This addition is created with future enhancement in mind. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required huge additions to the main classes such as UI, Model, Storage and more. This addition also required writing a lot of unit testcases.
