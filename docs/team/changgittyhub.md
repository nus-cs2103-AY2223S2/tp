### Project: Trackr

Trackr is a desktop tracking application used to keep track of order, menu, suppliers and tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* Added `Menu` Model including all field classes [\#177](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/177)
* Updated Storage related classes to allow for the storage of `Menu` objects [\#177](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/177)
* Completed `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `list` and `find` commands for `Menu` objects [\#177](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/177)
* Completed `edit` and `find` commands for `Order` objects [\#134](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/134)
* Contributed to `Calculate Menu Item Profit` feature [\#177](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/177)
  * Justification: Allow users to view their profit for each item on the menu.This sets up the foundation for the `Homepage Profit` feature that allows to view total profit from all orders.
* Maintain code quality - Refactor methods to obey OOP principles [\#281](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/issues/281)
* Improve test coverage and fixed test cases. [\#288](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/issues/288) [\#140](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/140)
* Updated and fixed `find_order` related bug [\#291](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/issues/291) and `Menu` related bugs  [\#235](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/issues/235) [\#188](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/issues/188)
* Contributed to the demo video.

* **New Feature**: Implemented a `Calculate Menu Item Profit` feature to get profit from item cost and item selling price.
  * What it does:
    * Allows users to see the profit of their item after adding their menu item to the menu.
  * Justification: This feature allows home business owners to see their profit for each menu item at one glance.This feature allows the total profit seen on the homepage to work as expected.
  * Highlights: Users are able to see the profit from each menu item without calculating manually.
