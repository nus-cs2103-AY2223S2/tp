### Project: Clock-Work

Clock-Work is a desktop application for managing tasks and assignments, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Clock-Work can get your
assignment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=joyngjr)
<br>
* **Refactoring** Added `Effort` component into Task [#85](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/85)
  * What it does: Effort serves as an estimate for students to gauge the amount of work required to complete a task.
  * Highlights:
    * Created classes for `Effort` and integrated it into TaskBook, refactoring relevant files and components as needed.
    * Modify UI of a Task so that effort for each task can be seen.
    * Modify `add` command and `edit` command to support `Effort`.
    * Add relevant unit testing for new classes.
<br>
* **New Feature** Added `Schedule` feature [#86](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/86)
  * What it does: `Schedule` creates a 30-day work plan for students based on tasks they entered in Clock-Work.
  * Highlights:
    * Created relevant classes for `Schedule`, from handling user input to data manipulation in storage.
    * Created `Plan` command and linked it to automatically run with `Schedule` as needed.
    * Created new Json files and storage classes `JsonPlannerStorage`, `JsonSerializablePlanner`, etc. to store generated plans so users can reload them.
    * Add relevant unit testing for newly created classes and integration testing for newly created storage.

* **New Feature** Added `Stats` feature [#63](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/63)
  * What it does: `Stats` displays the number of tasks for tag has in descending order, up to a maximum of 10.
  * Highlights:
    * Created relevant classes for `Stats`.
    * Add relevant unit testing for new classes.

  * Original: Only allow deletion at specified index.
  * Current: Allow `Delete` to delete tasks from multiple indices at once.
  * Highlights:
    * Create new `IndexList` class to support feature.
    * Add relevant unit testing for new features.
<br>
* **Enhancements Implemented** Extend capability of `Find` command to support find by `Effort` [#150](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/150)
  * Original: `Find` by name, description, tag, deadline, from, to
  * Current: `Find` by name, description, tag, deadline, from, to, and effort
