### Project: MediConnect

MediConnect is a hospital management application designed for local clinics. It is a centralised and efficient solution
to manage administrative matters, such as appointment and patient data management. The user interacts with it using a
CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to prescribe/unprescribe medication to/from patients.
    * What it does: Allows user to edit a patient's prescriptions one medication at a time, either by adding one, removing it, or changing the cost.
    * Justification:
      * Helps staff remember a patient's medication at checkout, especially if the receptionist and dispensary staff are different.
      * Allows doctor to access part of a patient's medical history in subsequent visits.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to calculate the bill for a patient's visit.
  * What it does: Shows the cost of all prescribed medication of a selected patient.
  * Justification: This feature will be used for every patient visit.
  * Highlights: This feature complicates future features which involve billable attributes.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=peanutbutters93&breakdown=true)
