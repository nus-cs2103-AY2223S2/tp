### Project: TutorPro

TutorPro is a desktop app designed to help private tutors manage their student information effectively.
Offers both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for managing student information.
The CLI provides a fast and efficient way to keep track of students' details, homework, lessons, and exams,
while the GUI offers an intuitive visual interface.
Whether tutoring a few or many students, TutorPro can streamline workflow.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

*  **Idea**: Came up with the idea of enhancing AB3 to a student management application for private tutors.

*  **New Feature**: Homework Feature and Six New Homework Related commands
    - what it does: The Homework Feature and Homework related commands are designed to help tutors manage their student homework tasks more efficiently. It allows tutors to create, view, update, and delete homework tasks using a set of commands. The new commands include: new-homework, view-homework, delete-homework, make-homework, unmark-homework, and update-homework commands.
    - Justification: The Homework Feature is aimed at addressing the common problem of managing multiple homework tasks for private tutors. With this feature, users can easily keep track of their students' assignments and deadlines, prioritize their work, and avoid missing important submission dates.
    - Highlights: The Homework Feature is easy to use and can be accessed through a set of simple commands. The feature helps tutors stay organized and on top of the students' homework tasks, reducing the risk of missing important deadlines.

*  **New Feature**: Redesigned GUI and Detailed Information Section
    - what it does: The new feature redesigns the UI of the application and adds a Detailed Information Section that provides more specific information about each student. The Detailed Information Section includes a Profile Page, a Homework Page, a Lesson Page, and an Exam Page. Each page is accessible through quick access buttons on the student card.
    - Justification: The redesigned UI and Detailed Information Section are aimed at improving the user experience of the application, making the application more aesthetically appealing. It provides a more user-friendly interface for tutors to manage their students' information and allows for more efficient navigation between different types of information.
    - Highlights: The Detailed Information Section provides more specific information about each student, including their personal information, homework assignments, past and upcoming lessons, and past and upcoming exams.

* **New Feature**: New Feature: Quick Access Button on Each Student Card
  - What it does: The Quick Access Button is a new feature that provides a more user-friendly interface for tutors to access student-specific information. It adds four buttons on each student card, including profile, homework, lessons, and exams. By clicking on any of these buttons, the user can quickly access the corresponding information for the selected student.
  - Justification: The Quick Access Button feature is aimed at improving the user experience for tutors who need to manage multiple students' profiles, homework, lessons, and exams. It helps to streamline the process of accessing student-specific information and eliminates the need for users to search through long lists to find the information they need.
  - Highlights: The Quick Access Button is easy to use and provides users with quick access to the information they need. The feature is intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy for users to navigate through the app and access the relevant information.
