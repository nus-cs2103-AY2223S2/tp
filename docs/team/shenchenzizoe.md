### Project: Medimate

MediMate (MM) is a cross-platform desktop application for medical professionals, specifically for private doctors or their receptionists, who are experienced with computers and currently using paper records to store patient information. With this solution, they will be able to better manage their patient data, including updating, accessing and adding new patient details easily. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implementing Time for Making and Ranking Appointments
    * What is does: This new feature provides the foundation for scheduling and appointment-making feature in the application. Users can select the specific time they want their appointment to start and end, in yyyy-mm-dd HHmm format. The appointment is ranked according to their start time.
    * Justification: Implementing time for making and ranking appointments provides users with greater control and accuracy in scheduling their appointments. This feature allows users to choose the exact time they want their appointment to start and end, rather than relying on vague time slots or estimates. Additionally, it allows users to better plan their schedule and manage their time effectively.
    * Highlights: 
    * Greater control and accuracy in scheduling appointments
      Ability to choose the exact start and end time of appointments
      Improved time management for users
      More detailed and precise appointment scheduling
      Enhanced overall user experience and satisfaction with the application.
  
* **New Feature**: UI for file list in Personal Detail Display Panel
    * What is does: This new feature adds a user interface (UI) for the file list in the personal detail display panel. Users can now view and manage their files directly from the personal detail display panel, without needing to navigate to a separate file management section. The file list UI includes options for uploading, viewing, deleting files, as well as generating MCs, with the files listed in alphabetical order.
    * Justification: Adding a file list UI to the personal detail display panel enhances the user experience by providing users with more convenient and efficient file management. Instead of always using command line interface or needing to navigate to a separate section of the application to manage their files, users can now do so directly from the personal detail display panel. This saves time and streamlines the file management process for users.
    * Highlights:
      More convenient and efficient file management
      User-friendly interface for managing files
      Saves time and streamlines the file management process
      Files listed in alphabetical order and updated in real time.
      Enhances the overall user experience and satisfaction with the application.
  
* **New Feature**: Button for create MC in UI
    * What is does: This new feature adds a button to the user interface (UI) for creating medical certificates (MCs). Users can now easily create MCs by clicking on the button and filling out the necessary information. The UI for creating MCs includes fields for doctor name, the duration of the certificate, and the medical condition for the certificate.
    * Justification: Adding a button for creating MCs in the UI enhances the user experience by providing users with a convenient and streamlined process for creating MCs. Instead of using command line and simply generate MCs without specific doctor name, to create an MC, users can generate comprehensive MCs with just a few clicks. This saves time and reduces the complexity of the process for users.
    * Highlights: 
      Convenient and streamlined process for creating MCs
      User-friendly interface for creating MCs
      Saves time and reduces complexity for users
      Includes input fields for doctor name, duration, and medical condition for the MC
      Enhances the overall user experience and satisfaction with the application.

* **New Feature**: Button for uploading, deleting, and viewing files in UI.
    * What is does: This new feature adds buttons to the user interface (UI) for uploading, deleting, and viewing files. Users can now easily upload, delete, and view files by clicking on the appropriate button and selecting the file they want to upload, delete, or view
    * Justification: Adding buttons for managing files in the UI enhances the user experience by providing users with a convenient and accessible way to manage their files. Instead of needing to type in long command to manage patient files, users can now do so with just a few clicks. This saves time and reduces the complexity of the file management process for users.
    * Highlights:
      Convenient and accessible way to manage files
      User-friendly interface for managing files
      Saves time and reduces complexity for users
      Includes options for uploading, deleting, and viewing files
      Enhances the overall user experience and satisfaction with the application.
