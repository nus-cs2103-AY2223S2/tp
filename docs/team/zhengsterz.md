### Project: Pied Piper


I took part in developing Pied Piper, a task management app that helps current and future university student
leaders take charge of their group projects. It allows students to more easily manage their group project,
and keep track of their teammates' progress while being able to rate their performances upon completion of
their assigned tasks.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability create different types of tasks.
  * What it does: allows the user to create tasks with deadlines of tasks that encompass an event.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of all upcoming tasks and know how time sensitive each task is.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{Idea for tasks was inspired by the IP}*
  * Pull requests: [\#17](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/17 ),[\#37](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/37/files ),[\#42](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/42/files ),[\#71](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/71)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store tasks in a UniqueTaskList.
  * What it does: stores all the tasks created by the user in a list that checks for uniqueness.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it ensures each unique task is not created more than once and also stores each task.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{UniqueTaskList was inspired by UniquePersonList}*
  * Pull requests: [\#37](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/37/files)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to comment on each individual task.
  * What it does: allows the user to comment on the quality of each completed task.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can expand his evaluation of a completed task beyond a score.
  * Pull requests:[\#72](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/72)

  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `todo` feature aka feature to add tasks.[\#173](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/173)
