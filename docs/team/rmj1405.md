### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)

Enhance life with WIFE! Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment <WIFE/> helps users to manage their food items in the fridge. With this, one never has to worry about optimizing storage and the organization of food items in their refrigerator.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to receive command specific help through the dynamic `help` command.

    * What it does: Users can receive help for each command by simply typing `help COMMAND`. For instance `help add` will display a brief description and format of the add command.
    * Justification: Users can receive quick and easy help within the application without having to search for the command in the User Guide. This enhances user experience and satisfaction by making access to help as convenient as possible.
    * Highlights: Implementing this feature required a thorough understanding of how commands were parsed from user input, transferred to the logic and output back to the UI once again. I was able to get a good understand of the codebase after working on this feature. Java `Enums` were also incorporated to create this feature.
  
<br/>

* **New Feature**: Added an `untag` command that allows the user to remove a tag from a food item.
  * What it does: Removes the tag with a given name from the food item listed at a specific index. For instance, `untag 1 n/dairy` removes the dairy tag from item 1.
  * Justification: This is a pair feature to tagging a food item to ensure CRUD capabilities for the food tags.
  * Highlights: Creating test cases for this feature posed a slight challenge as the command interacted with multiple levels of `Model` and `Logic` components. Working on the test cases gave me a greater understanding of how the `Model` worked.

<br/>

* **User Interface(UI)**: Designed UI mockup in Figma and styled application UI with JavaFX
    * Touched up overall application layout
    * Edited colours and restyled food item components and tags
    * Restyled help display
    * Enabled event handler for Enter button
  
  Key takeaways: JavaFX had a steep learning curve considering we were overhauling the entire AddressBook - Level 3â€™s UI. However, designing and modifying the UI was a fruitful experience, and I was able to practise adapting my current CSS knowledge to a new and unfamiliar library.
