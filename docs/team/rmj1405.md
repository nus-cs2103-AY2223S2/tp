### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)

Enhance life with WIFE! Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment <WIFE/> helps users to manage their food items in the fridge. With this, one never has to worry about optimizing storage and the organization of food items in their refrigerator.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to receive command specific help through the dynamic help command.

    * What it does: Users can receive help for each command by simply typing `help COMMAND`. For instance `help add` will display a brief description and format of the add command.
    * Justification: Users can receive quick and easy help within the application without having to search for the command in the User Guide. This enhances user experience and satisfaction by making access to help as convenient as possible.
  
<br/>

* **New Feature**: Added an untag command that allows the user to remove a tag from a food item.
  * What it does: Removes the tag with a given name from the food item listed at a specific index. For instance, `untag 1 n/dairy` removes the dairy tag from item 1.
  * Justification: This is a pair feature to tagging a food item to ensure CRUD capabilities for the food tags.

<br/>

* **User Interface(UI)**: Designed UI mockup in Figma and styled application UI with JavaFX
  * Touched up overall application layout
  * Edited colours and restyled food item components and tags
  * Restyled help display
  * Enabled event handler for Enter button
