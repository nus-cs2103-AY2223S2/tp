### Project: Trackr

Trackr is a desktop application used to keep track of order, suppliers and tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Refactor `Person` to support `Supplier` 
  * What it does: allows the user store `Supplier` and their relevant fields.
  * Justification: This feat improves the product significantly because the differentiation of customers and suppliers reflect user's mental models.
  * Highlights: Supports all pre-existing commands on Person

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=arkarsg&breakdown=true)
