### Project: SalesPunch

SalesPunch is a lightweight alternative Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
software, inspired by the conventional CRM software, such as SalesForce, but uses
a CLI-based user interface instead of a GUI, aimed towards enhancing efficiency
for fast typists.

Shown below are my contributions for this project. 

* **New feature**: Tasks
    * What it does: Provides the description of a task to be done.
    * Justification: A salesperson with many contacts and many tasks to do will find it difficult to recall all the 
      specific tasks that they need to do for all of their contacts. As such, Tasks was created to store the 
      descriptions of the tasks to be done for a particular contact.
    * Pull request: [#71](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W16-4/tp/pull/71)

* **New feature**: TaskList
  * What it does: Stores the list of tasks for each person.
  * Justification: A salesperson with multiple tasks for a contact will need to be able to interact with the list of 
    collection of tasks. As such, the TaskList was created to be able to allow the handling of the collection of tasks
    at a single location.
