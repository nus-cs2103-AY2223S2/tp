### Project: RIZZipe

RIZZipe is a desktop recipe book application used for busy cooks who want to track their recipes. The user interacts 
with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=alson001&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**:
* **Import** ([\#144](), [\#175]())
    * What it does: Allows users to import a JSON file that parses correctly to a RecipeBook
    * Justification: Enables users to quickly and easily add a large number of recipes at once from other sources
        * Implemented a file chooser to let the user pick a JSON file from their chosen directory
        * Made use of the existing `JsonUtil` class to parse the recipes information
* **Export** ([\#144](), [\#186]())
    * What it does: Allows users to export a JSON file that contains information detailing the current RecipeBook
    * Justification: Enables users to export JSON file to another user or other sources so they can import these recipes
    * with ease
        * Implemented a file chooser to let the user choose a directory to export the file to.
        * Made use of the existing data file to build the JSON file copy
