## **Project: SportSync**

SportSync is a desktop address book application used for coaching student athletes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## **New Features**

### Sort by attribute function [\#53](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/53)

Added the ability to sort the contact list by a given attribute.

* **What it does:** Calling sort with an integer attribute will arrange the list of contacts in the corresponding attribute.
* **Justification:** This features builds upon the previous default sorting function to allow users to sort by their preferred attributes in order to better fit their purposes.
* **Highlights:** Implementing this feature involved understanding the complex code flow and the relationship between many classes.

### Calculation functions in Sessions class [\#86](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/86)

Added the feature of consolidating total pay and attendance in a training session.

* **What it does:** Calculates the total payment and attendance from a training session based on athletes who are present.
* **Justification:** This feature allows the coach to get important information regarding his payment and attendance at one glance.
* **Highlights:** Implementing this feature required me to think of creative ways (e.g. data structure) to store the relevant information for iterating through during calculation.
