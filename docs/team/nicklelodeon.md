### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies. The target
users are managers who are responsible for assigning tasks and overseeing the work of a team.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, including but not limited
to difficulty in coordinating tasks among a large number of subordinates, possible work overload of any single
subordinate within a huge team and hassle of manually typing and sending out emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates' workloads and
allowing managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised and centralised manner. It also removes the manual
aspect of sending emails, as mass emails can be automated and sent with just a simple command!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Add task for OfficeConnect
    * What it does: With this new feature, users can add tasks to OfficeConnect
    * Justification: This feature is instrumental, as it allows users to create tasks that are stored into the storage of OfficeConnect. This creates the foundation for subsequent task commands, such as delete task or assign task
    * Highlights: Users who are quick at typing will be able to add tasks quickly following the syntax specified in the UserGuide
