### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel
at companies. The target users are managers who are responsible for assigning tasks and
overseeing the work of a team.

OfficeConnect provides managers a convenient way to manage their subordinates as it gives
managers an overview of their subordinates contacts and their teams  as well as track tasks
that the subordinates are responsible for completing.

Through OfficeConnect, managers can also plan deadlines, delegate tasks and automate sending
mass emails.
