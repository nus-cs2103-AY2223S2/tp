### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies. The target users are individuals who are responsible for assigning tasks and overseeing the work of a team.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, such as work overload among subordinates, difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees, and time-consuming manual tasks like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates' workloads, allowing managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised manner. The app also automates the process of planning and communicating with subordinates, making it easier for managers to get things done. Additionally, the app ensures that emails are sent during working hours, so that subordinates will not be disturbed outside of work.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Modified help window, more extensive

  * What it does: allows the user view help for each individual command that can be entered into OfficeConnect.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as he/she uses the app, as this extensive help window removes the need to go online and scour through all the documentation pages (which are not written for the user's use, anyway.)
  * Highlights: This enhancement gives the user a bird's eye view of the ways a command can be used in a digestable (TreeView, hierarchical like manner) that is intuitive and not stressful on the fingers of a slow typer.

* **New Feature**: To be added.
