### Project: CoDoc

CoDoc is a desktop contact management application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20.8k LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Edit command and edit command parser: [#48](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/48), [#66](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/66), [#141](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/141), [#201](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/201)
    * What it does: It is able to add and delete individual modules and skills from a person.
    * Justification: This allows the module and skill list to be easily updated. The original edit would only replace the original skill list with the new skills that the user fed as inputs.
    * Highlights: New prefixes were added, `m+/`, `m-/`, `s+/` and `s-/`. This allows the user to flexibly manage the lists without having to recreate the original list. For v1.2, there were other prefixes such as `so/` and `sn/` to represent a 1-to-1 update of the skill list. User would have to specify the old skill to be updated and the new skill. These were later removed in v1.3 as I realised that using `s-/` and `s+/` in the same command has the same functionality as `so/` and `sn/`.


* **New Feature**: Course List: [#120](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/120)
  * What it does: A list of courses that our application supports.
  * Justification: The list was introduced to standardize user inputs for courses, preventing users from inputting `cs` or `comp sci` to represent `Computer Science`. This helped to make our `find` function more user-friendly as users know what to search for, rather than having to toggle between the different names representing the same course. Users could simply input the index of the course that is shown in the left panel, minimising the keystrokes as well.
  * Highlights: This is displayed as a list with index numbers in the left panel of our application.

* **New Feature**: Help window: [#98](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/98), [#99](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/99)
  * What it does: Improved the help window to display a table of our command summary.
  * Justification: Experienced users need not refer to our user guide everytime they forget a specific command. They can simply refer to our command summary table in the help window and this would increase the user experience as it can be troublesome to reference the user guide everytime.
  * Highlights: The table also allows users to copy the commands and paste them into the text box, streamlining the user experience.

* **New Feature**: Copy url buttons: [#139](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/139), [#148](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/pull/148)
  * What it does: Allows user to copy the email address, github profile and linkedin profile links of a contact.
  * Justification: Improved the user experience as the links can be copied to their clipboard to be used in their browser.
  * Highlights: Copy to clipboard
  * Credits: The original copy url button that was meant for the user guide link in the help window.
