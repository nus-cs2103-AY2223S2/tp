### Project: Bookopedia

Bookopedia is a desktop application specifically built for parcel delivery riders, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This enables delivery riders to be able to quickly plan their deliveries by typing in commands and still be able to view them in an organized manner.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=skeltons&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view deliveries in more detail.
    * What it does: Shows more information about the selected delivery
    * Justification: Extra information pertaining to the delivery (such as number of attempts) were not shown in the delivery list as it will make it look messy and clutter, hence the view command is needed to get these extra information.
    * Highlights: 
        * There is a section in the GUI dedicated to show the extra information of a delivery.
        * Any time a command make changes to a delivery, the delivery will show up in the Viewing Section of the UI to allow the user to verify said changes.
    * Credits: This feature was implemented by following the tutorial provided by SEEDU.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Redesigned the GUI to work with the `view` command which includes a pane to display more information about the delivery of interest
    * Redesigned the GUI to reduce clutter in the delivery list

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the `view` feature
    * Developer Guide:
