### Project: Pied Piper

I took part in developing Pied Piper, a task management app that helps current and future university student
leaders take charge of their group projects. It allows students to more easily manage their group project,
and keep track of their teammates' progress while being able to rate their performances upon completion of
their assigned tasks.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added command to mark/unmark tasks
    * What it does: Allows the user to mark a task as complete / not completed
    * Justification: This is an important feature as being a task management app, a must-have requirement is the ability to mark a task as completed
    * Credits: Inspired from iP
    * Pull Requests: [\#56](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/56)

* **New Feature**: Added command to review a person
    * What it does: Provides important statistics for a person, such as the number of tasks assigned, number of tasks completed, and average score for all completed tasks
    * Justification: A key feature of Pied Piper is to rate the performance of team members to mimic the real world performance review system, hence this was an essential feature to add
