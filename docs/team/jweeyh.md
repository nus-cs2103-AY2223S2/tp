Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Update new GUI.[[PR#168]](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/168)
    * What it does: New GUI incorporating information from leaves, employee, departments. Data shown now
      automatically refreshes whenever a change is made in any of the sections.
    * Justification: The new GUI has to be built robustly in order for all backend operations to display
      the results clearly and without errors. New icon designed to give a new unique identity to the 
      project
    * Highlights: Leaves, employees and department data are shown side by side in a scrollable pane that 
      allows for seamless transition between the different outputs from commands.
    * Credits: AddressBook initial GUI which was a good foundation to structure out display on.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jweeyh&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
