### Project: Army Information Management System

Army Information Management System is a desktop address book application built to handle the personal information of
military personnel. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to copy information of a person to the user's clipboard.
    - What it does: Allows a user to quickly copy information of a person to the clipboard without manually selecting
      the information to copy.
    - Justification: This feature allows the user to save time by not needing to manually select and copy the
      information. It also allows the user to bypass the problem where the user interface (UI) does not allow text to be
      selected and copied.
