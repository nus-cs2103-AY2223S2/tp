### Project: SalesPUNCH

#### Overview

SalesPunch is a lightweight alternative Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
software, inspired by the conventional CRM software, such as SalesForce, but uses
a CLI-based user interface instead of a GUI, aimed towards enhancing efficiency
for fast typists.

#### New Features Implemented
* **Transactions Feature**: Add / Delete / Edit / List transaction records
  * **What it does**: Provides a modifiable list of transaction records. A transaction record contains the following information:
    description, value status and owner of the transaction. The user can add a transaction record providing the four fields, delete an existing transaction record
    with its index in the transaction list, edit any of the four fields of a transaction record and view all transaction records in a list.
  * **Justification**: A salesperson conducts business with contacts and facilitate multiple transactions, it would be beneficial for him or her
    to document transaction particulars and associate them with their respective contacts.
  * **Highlights**: Implementation of transaction-contact relationship. Transaction records added must be linked to an existing contact in the contact list.
