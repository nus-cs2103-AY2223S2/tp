### Project: Tutee managing system (TMS)

Tutee managing system (TMS) is a desktop application designed for admins working at tuition center managing courses, tutors and students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TMS utilizes your fast typing ability to execute your management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
