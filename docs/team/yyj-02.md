### Project: GoodMatch

GoodMatch is a desktop application used for managing applicants and job listings for hiring managers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
