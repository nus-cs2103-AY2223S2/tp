### Project: SalesPunch

SalesPunch is a lightweight alternative Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
software, inspired by the conventional CRM software, such as SalesForce, but uses
a CLI-based user interface instead of a GUI, aimed towards enhancing efficiency
for fast typists.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
