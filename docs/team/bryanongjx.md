### Project: Fish Ahoy!

*Fish Ahoy!* Is a **desktop app for managing your fish, fish tanks, and relevant tasks, optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br>

*Fish Ahoy!* **streamlines** the fish keeping experience by helping you keep track of your many **fishes**, **tanks** and
**weekly tasks**, such as feeding and cleaning.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add priorities to tasks.
  * What it does: allows the user to assign priorities (low / medium / high) to tasks.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows users to priorities their tasks and later sort them in the user interface.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added species attribute to fish that allows user to specify their fish's species.
  * What it does: allows the user to assign species to fishes.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows users to specify species which later is tagged to an icon of their fish implemented by my other group member.
  * Highlights: This was one of the first few features to be added and served as a foundation for many features in later milestones
