### Project: Paidlancers

Paidlancers is a **desktop app for keeping track of your freelancing events, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Paidlancers can get your freelancing event management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**:
  * `Mark Event` Added ability to mark events once they are completed. (Pull Request [#84](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/84))
      * What it does: Allows the user to mark events.
      * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of all the events they have completed. This is useful for users who cannot remember which event has been completed.
      * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and the creation of new ones.

* **New Feature**:
  * `revenue` Added ability to calculate and display the total revenue of completed events. (Pull Request [#114](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/114))
      * What it does: Allows the user to calculate total revenue.
      * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of total revenue earned thus far. This is useful for users who wishes to keep track of how much they have earned.
      * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. With a good understanding of the design, it is possible to implement the code with minimal changes.
