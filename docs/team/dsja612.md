### Project: TechTrack

{{ site.data.techtrack.about.summary }}

I worked on the entire stack, both frontend and backend. I was mainly in charge of refactoring and working on the new UI.

### **Contributions**

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store a `JobDescription` field.
  * What it does: TechTrack users can now store job descriptions for each role.
  * Justification: The addition of the JobDescription field provides TechTrack users with an essential field for managing and tracking jobs.
    A job description is essential as it explains the tasks, duties, function and responsibilities of a role.
  * Highlights: TechTrack users can now add their own job descriptions. As job descriptions have many forms, we decided
    not to place restrictions on this field, other than it being non-empty. Also added more tests for this field.
* **Refactoring**: Refactored the `Address` field to the `Company` field.
  * What it does: TechTrack users can now store the `company` for each role.
  * Justification: After discussion, we felt that the `Address` field would not be useful for TechTrack's use case. We also plan to
  include a `Company` field for all roles. Hence, it would be easier to refactor `Address` to represent `Company` instead.
  * Highlights: Refactored AB3 code and tests. Updated sample data to reflect examples of companies.
* **New Feature & Refactoring**: Add a new `View` command to display more details of a role in a better format.
  * What it does: Edited the `Role Card` to only display important details. The user can view more lengthy/less significant details
  using the `view {index}` command, which replaces the `ResultDisplay` of the UI with a `RoleDisplay`.
  * Justification: Displaying all 10 fields of a `Role` in each `Role Card` would not look aesthetically pleasing, 
  especially with longer fields like `JobDescription`. We decided to refactor the UI to support multiple displays. As of now, we only need 2 types
  of displays from output of commands: one for `String`, another for `Role`. The type of display can be easily made extendable 
  in the future, if needed.
* **Testing**: Refactored old variables in test classes to reflect the changes in TechTrack.
* **Enhancements**
  * Enhanced help window to show list of commands for all messages
  * Add message on startup to let the user know if TechTrack fails to load a file
  * Improved support of unnecessarily long fields for the UI
  * Change legacy logging details
* **Bug Fixes**
  * Fixed a bug where TechTrack crashes if a `Deadline` field in `TechTrack.json` is past the current date
  * Fixed a bug where loading sample data on a fresh installation of TechTrack would cause the program to crash
* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Constructed outline of UG for team members to edit easily, and fixed bugs
    * Proofread and checked for grammatical errors
  * Developer Guide:
    * Proofread and checked for grammatical errors
    * Added the `view command`, `UI Enhancement` section, which are features that I implemented
    * Updated manual tests for `tag`, `name`, `clear`, `help`, `list`, `exit` command.
    * Checked for bugs in UML diagrams.
    * Wrote the `Planned enhancements for Feature Flaws` section
    * Wrote the `Effort` section
* **Contribution to team-based tasks**:
  * Sourcing of images
    * Sourced for application icon from [PNGEgg](https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-ewtjs)
    * Sourced for contact icon for `view` command from [icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/104074/contact-us)
    * Sourced for more details icon for `view` command from [icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/set/details/color)
  * Created tags for PE-D issue triaging
  * Ensure DG and UG are properly formatted and split into coherent sections 
  * Removed all remnants of AB3 from JavaDocs of test code.
  * Added summary text to `/docs/data/techtrack.yml` to ensure summary of TechTrack is consistent among
    documents
* **Review/mentoring contributions**
