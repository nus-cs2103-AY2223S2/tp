### Project: Dengue Hotspot Tracker

Dengue Hotspot Tracker is a desktop app for managing dengue cases. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 9.5 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=markusyeo)


* **Enhancements implemented:**
  * **New Feature**: Changed default file storage format to be CSV
    * Justification: As we deal with tabular data, we would like users to be able to easily view the data entered into `DengueHotspotTracker` offline. Additionally NEA personnel are more likely to be familiar with CSV than json!
  * **New Feature**: Added the ability to import and export data as a csv file
    * Justification: This feature allows users to edit csv files to be able to import into `DengueHotspotTracker` and export out of. Additionally allowing users to export files, edit them offline, then import them back into the DHT, which may be more convenient for sharing information with those without direct access to the DengueHotspotTracker.


* **Contributions to the UG:**
  * Reformatted the User Guide to be more readable
  * Added documentation for the `import`, `export` and `checkout` command
  * Added `Navigating the User Guide` portion to help users to understand the Ui



* **Contributions to the DG:**./
    * to be added soon


* **Contributions to the team-based tasks:**
    * Refactored the entire code base including test cases to be adapted for Dengue Hotspot Tracker.


* **Review/mentoring contributions:**
    * to be added soon


* **Contributions beyond the project team:**
