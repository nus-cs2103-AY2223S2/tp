### Project: AddressBook Level 3

Trackr is a desktop application used to keep track of order, menu, suppliers and tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=chognweiguan&breakdown=true)
  * All _reused_ code are adapted from the [AB3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/tp) code base (both functional and test code).
    * The code could be refractored out to be a more standard format for repetitive use in our project.
    * The code could be adapted to fit the different models that we have.

* **Contributions to code base**:
  * Added `Order` and `Customer` Models including all field classes [\#100] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/100), [#107] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/107)
  * Updated Storage related classes to allow for the storage of `Order` objects [\#114] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/114)
  * Completed `add` and `delete` commands for `Order` objects [#120] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/120)
  * Completed `upload csv` feature [\178] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/178)
    * Justification: Allow users to transfer existing data from their excel sheet to trackr efficiently.
  * Updated and fixed `Order` related bugs [#272] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/272)

* **Review / Peer Help**:
  * Helped teammates with debugging and implementation issues.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Documented `upload csv` feature [#185] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/185)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated UML Diagrams for `Logic` component [\#154] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/154)
    * Added activity diagram for `ListCommand` [\#171] (https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/pull/171)

* **Community**:
  * Approved a number of PRs
