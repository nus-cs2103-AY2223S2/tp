### Project: Paidlancers

Paidlancers is a desktop app designed to help freelancers streamline their event management tasks. It is the brainchild me and my team, who wanted to simplify and automate the administrative side of freelancing.

The app is optimized for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Some of its features include adding and linking contacts to events, tracking rates, marking events as done, creating new events, viewing event lists and revenue, and more.

By centralizing all event-related information and tasks in one place, Paidlancers aims to increase productivity and help freelancers focus on their craft.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * `Unmark Event` Added ability to mark events once they are completed. (Pull Request [#108](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/108))

      * What it does: Allows the user to unmark events.
      * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can unmark events which were accidently marked as done or when an event requires follow-up actions. This is useful for users who need flexibility in tracking completed and uncompleted events.
      * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and the creation of new ones.
