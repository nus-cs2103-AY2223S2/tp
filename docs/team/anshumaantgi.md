### Project: The Intern's Ship

**The Intern's Ship (TinS)** is a desktop application for computing students looking for internships to more efficiently manage
their numerous internship applications. Suited for fast typers, TinS uses a combination of Command Line Interface (CLI)
to collect user inputs and Graphic User Interface (GUI) to display relevant information for ease of use.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability add an event to Tins.
    * What it does: 
      * Allows the user to add an event after selecting an internship. ([#104](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/104))
    * Justification: This feature is vital for users to use Tins, as it ensures the users can add different event associated with their internship applications.
    * Highlights: It involved making a parser and command class that adhered with the current logical structure and made semantic sense to the user.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability delete an event from Tins.
    * What it does:
        * Allows the user to delete an event after selecting an internship. ([#129](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/129))
    * Justification: This feature is vital for users to use Tins, as it ensures the users can delete added events associated with their internship applications.
    * Highlights: It involved making a parser and command class that adhered with the current logical structure and made semantic sense to the user.

    * User Guide:
        * Crafted initial documentation for the feature `event add` ([#115](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/115))
    * Developer Guide:
        * Crafted Use Case and User Story for `event add ` function.([#115](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/115))
        * Crafted Implementation for `event add` function. ([#115](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/115))
        * Modified `Model` Design to accomadate for Tins. ([#115](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/115))
