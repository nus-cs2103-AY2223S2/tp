### Project: NeoBook

NeoBook is a desktop application for NUS students to better manage their contacts and the events they have scheduled with them. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add checks for NusMods integration (PR [#116](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/116))
  * What it does: Checks whether the modules in the system are valid
  * Justification: We do not want users to be adding in non-existent modules into the system
  * Highlights: This features incorporates data from the NusMods API and ensures that the system only handles valid inputs
**New Feature**: Add command to edit events (PR [#163](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/163))
  * What it does: Allows the user to edit existing events and change the data in a specific field
  * Justification: We want users to be able to edit data for a better user experience, as opposed to deleting and adding a new event
  * Highlights: This feature required extensive implementation and interaction with the user data, parser, logic and model components
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=shuggan&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
  * Mainly helped to maintain and update the tP's documentation
  * Brainstorming of potential features
  * Conducted bug catching on our own tP to catch any noteworthy bugs before final submission 

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Created additions to the event feature

* **Documentation**:
