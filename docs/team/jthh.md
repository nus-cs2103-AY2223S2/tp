### Project: TrAcker

TrAcker - TrAcker is a desktop event management application for NUS CS2040 Teaching Assitants (TA). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: added the utility to add/edit/delete customized notes.
    * What it does: it enables TAs to add/edit/delete their notes from weekly progress meetings or consultation sessions with students.
    * Justification: it is useful since TAs are managing many students with different needs and also they are tasked with multiple duties. In order for them to keep themselves organized, they need such noting systems.
    * Highlights: it has good usability and can be managed efficiently.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
