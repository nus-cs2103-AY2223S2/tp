### Project: Tutee Managing System (TMS)

Tutee Managing System (TMS) is a **desktop application designed for private tutors managing students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TMS utilizes your fast typing ability to execute your management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

<!-- * **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}* -->

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to copy and add existing students.
  * What it does: allows the user to add and existing student to TMS that wants to be tutored for other subjects or timeslots without having to key in all the student particulars again.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user quickly add new lessons for students.
  * Highlights: This enhancement builds upon the `add command` feature and required use of the `editCommand` feature as well. The combination of these two features results in the current `copy command`.
