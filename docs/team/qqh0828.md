### Project: MATHUTORING

MATHUTORING comes in to centralise the features into a single application with a contact management system to track the students’ progress report which subsequently allows the tutors to plan their lesson plan for future lessons and overall view of their schedule for ease of planning.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  1. Add a score to a student [#75](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/pull/75)
     * What it does: With this new feature, user can add a score to a student.
     * Justification: This feature is important as users can keep track of the student's performance by adding their exam scores.
     * Highlights: User can add new scores at any time. After adding a new score, it will be automatically saved in the student's unique score list.
                   When scores are checked by 'check' command, they will be automatically displayed with sorted order that nearest score shown at front.
  
  2. Delete a score to a student [#75](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/pull/75)
     * What it does: With this new feature, user can delete a score from a student.
     * Justification: This feature is important as a use may add a wrong score and want to delete or edit it.
     * Highlights: User can delete an existing scores at any time. After deleting an existing score, it will be automatically updated in the student's unique score list.
  
  3. Score list chart and table statistic summary of recent five scores [#101](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/pull/101) [#106](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/pull/106)
     * What it does: With ths new feature, user can view student's performance easily.
     * Justification: The chart and the table statistic summary can easily show the student's recent performance, hence the user can plan their future sessions easily to suit the student's needs.
     * Highlights: There are three colours to represent the different level of exam scores, e.g. red colour in percentage table column represents the decreasing grades.
