### Project: VaccinationManagementSystem

The Vaccination Management System (VMS) is a Java desktop application used for **managing and keeping track of vaccination appointments**.
VMS is **optimised for users that can type fast and prefer Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
VMS has both CLI, for users to input commands, and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX, that is used primarily to give visual feedback to the user.

Given below are my contributions to the project

* **New Feature**: Added an `Appointment` class to VMS
  * What it does: allows the users to **manage and keep track of vaccination appointments**.

    * R - list all existing `Appointment` object in VMS.
    * U - edit an existing `Appointment` object in VMS.
    * D - delete an existing `Appointment` object from VMS.
  * Justification: this feature enables users to **manage and keep track of vaccination appointments**.
