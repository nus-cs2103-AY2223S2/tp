{% include ppp-summary.html %}

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: `Integration of Department and Leave` [PR#84](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/84)

  - What was done: Integrated the usecases of Department level functionalities to allow users to query headcount for the departments by taking into account the leaves taken by each employee in the specific department.
  - Justification: This feature makes the user experience more cohesive.
  - Highlights:
    - Required deep understanding of both Department and Leave functionalities implementation as well as the base structure for integration.
    - Benefited from the open-close principle used for the design of Department and Leave Functionalities.
  - Relevant pull request: [PR#156](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/156), [PR#197](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/197)

- **Enhancements to existing features**:

  - What was done: Refactored the codebase and the testcases to fit our usecase of SudoHr and Employees.
  - Justification: Make our codebase consistent with the domain language that we are using to communicate and develop the application.
  - Highlights:
    - Deep understanding of the control flow to ensure that the refactored parts did not cause bugs in the original functionality.
    - Advanced use of refactoring tools in the IDE to ensure that all the components and their dependencies were refactored efficiently and accurately.
