### Project: HospiSearch

HospiSearch is a desktop app for healthcare administrators to manage hospital/clinic patients' particulars and optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HospiSearch can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
