### Project: GoodMatch

GoodMatch is a desktop application used for managing applicants and job listings for hiring managers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Refactoring**: Refactor codebase to change context from AddressBook to ListingBook for GoodMatch
  * AddressBook => ListingBook
  * Person => Listing
  * Tag => Applicant
  * Collaborated with Homun Tan([homuntan02](https://github.com/homuntan02)): I duplicated and changed relevant files while he deleted relevant files and completed refactoring.
  * Pull request [\#51](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/pull/51)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability view all job listings.
    * What it does: allows the user to view all existing job listings.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to keep track of all the job listings they have.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It allows all other commands to be able to display results.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability edit applicants.
  * What it does: allows the user edit the names of existing applicants.
