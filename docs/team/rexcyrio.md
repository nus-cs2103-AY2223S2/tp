### Project: Army Information Management System

Army Information Management System (AIMS) is a desktop address book application built to handle the personal information of military personnel. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the `undo` feature
  - What it does: allows the user to undo previous modifications done to AIMS.
  - Justification: The user is able to quickly undo his/her mistakes, rather than search through all the contacts to find the incorrect data entry and correct it.
  - Highlights: This command saves the state of AIMS after every **successful** command run -- this way, we do not have to rely on each command implementing its own "undo" capability correctly.

- **New Feature**: Added a command history to allow the user to view and (re-)run any previous commands
  - What it does: When the user presses the up arrow (`↑`), they can view an earlier command run; when the user presses the down arrow (`↓`), they can view a later command run.
  - Highlights: This command history feature synergises well with the `undo` command when the user makes a minor mistake.
    - e.g., If the user edits a person's contact details and makes a typo, he can run `undo` to undo the edit command, use the command history to get back the edit command, correct the typos in the edit command and press enter again.
