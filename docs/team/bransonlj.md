### Project: The Intern's Ship

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `StatsCommand` that showed the user useful statistical data based on the internship applications and events, and created `Statistics` and `Datapoint` data classes for use in tandem with `StatsCommand`.

* **New Feature**: Added `DeleteAllCommand` that allowed the user to delete all data after confirmation.

* **New Feature**: Added `EditCommand` that allowed the user to edit specified fields of a selected internship.

* **New Feature**: Added `SelectCommand` that showed the user details of a selected internship and selected that internship for use in other commands (mainly event commands).

* **New Feature**: Added `HomeCommand` that showed user upcoming events reminder and list of commands that can be used.

* **Project management**:
    * Worked with team to help design the overall architecture of application.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Update `CommandResult` for use with UI and new commands by using `ResultType` enums (Pull requests [\#126](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/126), [\#128](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/128))
    * Update `Start`, `End`,`EventParserUtil` and related class to closely follow design of other classes and cleanly handle runtime errors (Pull request [\#199](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/199))

* **Documentation**:
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `selct` and `stats` feature.
