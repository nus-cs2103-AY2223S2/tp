### Project: EduMate

EduMate is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 30 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=kennycjy&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**: [Tag command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/TagCommand.java) Implemented the `Tag` and `Untag` commands.
  * Justification: The command allows user to tag and untag modules additively to persons without going through the `edit` command.
* **Enhancement**: Collaborated with [@mynameizzhafeez](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w14-2.github.io/tp/team/mynameizzhafeez.html) to modify tag and untag implement `Lessons`
  * Justification: Needed a way to assign lessons to persons in the address book while holding information about the module it belongs to.
* **Enhancement**: Modified `Tag` and `Untag` command to allow tagging and untagging of groups.
  * Justification: The command allows user to tag and untag groups without going through `edit` command

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Pushed the first version of the User Guide that is drafted by the whole team.
        * Updated the user guide for areas pertaining to `Tag` and `Untag`
    * Developer Guide:
        * Updated the developer guide for areas pertaining to `Tag` and `Untag`
        * Updated the developer guide for testing to allow new developers to understand the types of testing we did and the rationale behind choosing such types.

* **Testing**:
  * Testing for `Tag` and `Untag` commands as the command was implemented.
  * More tests were carried out and changed as the command evolved to take on more executions.
