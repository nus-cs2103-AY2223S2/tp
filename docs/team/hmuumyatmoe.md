### Project: Trackr

Trackr is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* Added the ability to add tasks to a task list and list tasks.
    * What it does:
        * Allows users to add tasks with task description, deadline of task and completion status (DONE / NOT DONE) of task.
    * Justification: This feature is made to cater to the needs of home business owners as they usually have a lot of tasks (such as ordering supplies, making deliveries) to deal with
      and the app provides a convenient way to record down and get an overview of their tasks.
    * Credits: Code is adapted from [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/tp) created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)

* Added the ability to edit existing tasks and list tasks.
    * What it does:
        * Allows users to edit existing tasks so that they can keep tasks details correct and up to date.
        * Justification: This feature improves the product because users may sometimes key in the wrong info
          and this feature allows users to modify wrong task details easily.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort orders and tasks according to a given criteria.
    * What it does:
        * Allows users to sort tasks or orders according to a given criteria.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because home business owners has a lot of orders and tasks
      and may wish to quickly find out which orders or tasks are more urgent at one glance.
      This feature provides a convenient way for the home business owners to do so.
    * Highlights: Users are able to sort the tasks or orders based on various criterias (Task Name, Task Deadline, Task Status, Time added, Task Status and Deadline)
