### Project: PlanEase

PlanEase is designed for users who work as event planners.
It provides a centralised platform for them to manage their work, contacts, and events information, making the process of searching for stakeholders and keeping track of details easier and more efficient.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an event tagging feature to the `add` and `edit` command ([\#48](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/48))
  * What it does: Allows user to tag an existing event to a person 
  * Justification: This improves the product because a user can associate events to persons in the event planner. 
  * Highlights: While this is similar to the previous `tag` feature, user can add an event tagged to a person through the event index, user need not enter the entire event name.
  
* **New Feature**: Added a `listevcontact` command to list all contacts associated to an event ([\#56](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/pull/56))
  * What it does: Allows user to list all persons with a specified event tagged to them 
  * Justification: This improves the product because a user easily can get a filtered list of persons who are associated to a specific event. 
  * Highlights: User can list all contacts associated to the specified event simply through the event index, user need not type out the entire event name.
