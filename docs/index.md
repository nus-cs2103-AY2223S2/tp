* PowerConnect is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PowerConnect can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps <br>
  Example usages:
    * keep track of student grades
    * adding comments to students
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `PowerConnect` (`PC` for short) because it provides teacher a powerful application to connect with their students.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
