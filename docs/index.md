**MODTrek is a desktop application for managing a typical NUS Computer Science student’s modules and degree progression, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). The app provides a convenient platform for students to easily access and update their modules within presses of a keyboard.**
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI.

* If you are interested in using MODTrek, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing MODTrek, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
