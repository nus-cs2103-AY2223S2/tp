**FastTrack is the answer to your expense management prayers.** It is a desktop application with a GUI. Most of the user interactions, however, happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using FastTrack, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing FastTrack, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
