**Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for managing teaching assistant activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).**

With TAA, you can easily track student attendance and grades using just a keyboard, eliminating the need for multiple clicks.
You can even view grade statistics without the use of a dedicated data analysis application!

* If you are interested in using TAA, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TAA, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
