HospiSearch is a **desktop app for managing hospital/clinic patients' particulars, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. HospiSearch can help you complete your contact management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps, regardless of your typing speed.

* If you are interested in using HospiSearch, head over to the [**User Guide**](UserGuide.html).
* If you are interested about developing HospiSearch, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
