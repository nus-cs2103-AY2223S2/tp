InternBuddy is a desktop application for Computing undergraduates to manage their internship applications.
It is optimized for typing where it allows you to complete internship management tasks much more efficiently
via the keyboard as compared to using traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications.
If you are a fast typist who is seeking a one-stop platform to systematically organise your internship
applications, then InternBuddy is the perfect buddy to accompany you during your internship hunt.

InternBuddy runs using Java 11, and is available on the Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.


* If you are interested in using InternBuddy, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t14-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing InternBuddy, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t14-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.


## Acknowledgements

* InternBuddy is written in **Java 11**.
* It is adapted from the [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) project created by
  the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* Libraries and frameworks used: [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson),
  [JUnit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5) and [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX).
* GUI testing is implemented with references from [AddressBook Level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4)
  and [Please Hire Us](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp). We utilised code from these projects to set
  up GUI testing and added our own test cases to test the UI components that we created.
* The feature of Navigating Through Past Commands is primarily adapted from  [HackNet](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp),
  but we added code modifications and test cases.
* The sections on explaining the formatting standards and GUI interface in the User and Developer Guides are
  inspired by [Please Hire Us](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp).
