WIFE is always right. Our product **Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)** helps users to **manage their 
food items** in the fridge. With this, one never have to worry about **optimizing 
storage** and **organization of food items** in a refrigerator, thereby reducing waste and improving the 
efficiency of grocery shopping.
