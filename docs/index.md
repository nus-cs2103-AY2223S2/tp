coNtactUS is a module tracker for designed specially for NUS computing students, by NUS computing students. 

In order for NUS computing students to function effectively and productively in university,
It is important for them to keep track of a variety of information related to their modules.

* Lecture and tutorial timeslots
* Lecture and tutorial venues
* Deadlines
* Module official resources
* Module notes
* Contact details of Professors and Teaching assistants 

and more...


NUS computing students may find it hard to keep track of all these information. They may feel overwhelmed by the 
constant influx of weekly lectures, tutorials, deadlines and assignments. They may also find it difficult to keep their 
module resources and notes well-organised.

coNtactUS provides an excellent one-stop solution for NUS computing students to solve all of the above problems. 
By providing a centralised platform for NUS computing students to conveniently store and access information about their 
modules, coNtactUS helps them become the most productive and organised version of themselves. 
Even better, coNtactUS is optimised for use via typing instead of clicking, which allows them to store and retrieve 
information faster than ever before.
