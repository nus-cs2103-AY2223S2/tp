**CareFlow is a desktop application for patient and drug inventory management of medical clinics.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using CareFlow, head over to the [**User Guide**](UserGuide.html).
* If you are interested about developing CareFlow, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
