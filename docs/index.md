**The Intern's Ship (TinS)** is a desktop application for **internship-seeking university students** to more efficiently
and conveniently manage, coordinate and keep track of their numerous internship applications. Despite being optimised
for use via Command Line Interface (CLI), TinS also provides its user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enable
its users to navigate the application with ease.

* If you are interested in using TinS, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
