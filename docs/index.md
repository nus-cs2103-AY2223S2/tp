**Bookopedia** is a desktop application specifically built for parcel delivery riders, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This enables delivery riders to be able to quickly plan their deliveries by typing in commands and still be able to view them in an organized manner.

* If you are interested in using Bookopedia, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Bookopedia, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
