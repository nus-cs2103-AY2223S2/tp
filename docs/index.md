**Wingman is a desktop application for airline managers to manage resources efficiently and quickly.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Wingman, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w11-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#getting-started).
* If you are interested about developing Wingman, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w11-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
