* This is BookFace, an NUS-centered address book application.
  Example usages:
    * Add contacts along with the image of the person
    * Quickly import university related contacts
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called BookFace) used for managing
  contact details of NUS staff/students.
* It is named BookFace because it is an address book organizer with photos of the contacts you save.

* If you are interested in using BookFace, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing BookFace, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
