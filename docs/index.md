* ExecutivePro is a desktop application for managing employee details by Human Resource(HR) managers. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using ExecutivePro, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md).
* If you are interested about developing ExecutivePro, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
