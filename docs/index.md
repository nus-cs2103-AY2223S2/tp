An increasing number of vaccinations now have more complicated prerequisites to take them, and Vaccination Management System (VMS) aims to make this validation easier. **VMS is a desktop application for validating and keeping track of vaccination appointments**; its operations are **optimized for fast typists who prefer using a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested in using VMS, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing VMS, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
