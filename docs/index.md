AutoM8 is a desktop application for auto repair shops that combines the efficiency of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the user-friendliness of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) making it easy for users to manage tasks such as customer records, vehicle information, services, appointments, and inventory tracking. AutoM8 is a powerful tool that helps auto repair shops save time and increase productivity.
