MyLib is a desktop application originally developed to bookmark webnovels and comics. However, its bookmarking features can accomodate basically any form of content you want to track. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using MyLib, head over to the [How to use the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#how-to-use-the-user-guide) section of the **User Guide**.
* If you are interested about developing MyLib, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
