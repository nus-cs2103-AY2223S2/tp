* We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
* The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.
*  The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
*  Log messages are output through the console and to a `.log` file.
