SudoHR is a desktop application meant to help small Singaporean companies consolidate
data regarding their employees, departments and leaves.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, SudoHR can get your management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
