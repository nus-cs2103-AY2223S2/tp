### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`Files`**](#files-component): Manage the uploaded and created files to the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the five main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagramUltimate.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of various parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `DetailDisplay` and etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/NewModelClassDiagram.png" width="900" height="510" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Files component
**API** : [`Files.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/files/Files.java)

<img src="images/FilesClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Files` component,
* Multiple files handling capabilities: The `Files` component is designed to handle various file types, such as PDF and images. 
* It is capable of processing these files, rendering them for display, and managing their storage.
* Inheritance: By implementing both `FileReader` and `FileGenerator` interfaces, 
* the `Files` component provides a flexible foundation for specialized file handling classes, such as `PdfReader` and `ImageReader`. 
* This modular design allows the component to extend its functionality when needed.
* Dependency on `FileReaderManager` and `FileManager`: The `Files` component relies on the `FileReaderManager` class to determine which specialized file handler to use based on the input file type. 
* The `FileManager` class, in turn, utilizes the `FileReaderManager` to manage and process different file types effectively.
* Interaction with the UI component: The `PdfReader` and `ImageReader` classes are responsible for rendering the files in a format suitable for display. 
* They return the rendered files to the UI component, which then presents the content to the user.
### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 1. Making appointment
This feature servers as one of the core features of MediMate, so how is it implemented?

This feature is achieved by the following classes:
* `AddAppointmentCommand` - when executed, it will add a new appointment to a specified patient
* `AddAppointmentCommandParser` - will parser user's input and return a valid `AddAppointmentCommand` for execution

The format of command line input is as follows:
`makeApp {patientIndex} /from {startTime} /to {endTime}`

Initially, when the input is received, it is processed by the UI layer, which calls the
logic.execute(input) function and transfers the control to the logic layer. The execute(input)
function in the logic layer then utilizes the `AddressBookParser` to break down the input into tokens,
determine the commandÊ¼s mode and calls relevant commandParser for further parsing. In this feature, specifically, 
`AddAppointmentCommandParser` will be called.

Then, inside this parser, there are mainly three information being parsed:
* patientIndex - parsed by `parserIndex` method in `ParserUtil` class
* startTime - parsed by `parserDate` methond in `ParserUtil` class
* endTime - parsed by `parserDate` methond in `ParserUtil` class

After all these pieces of information are being parserd, the parser class will create a new `AddAppointmentCommand` class
and transfer all information to it for further execution.

Then inside this command class, it will use all the information inputted by user to create a new patient with all other 
details remaining the same while the only change in its `appointment` and then it calls model manager to substitute previous patient
with the new one by calling `model.setPerson(previousPerson, newPerson)`

Finally, `ModelManager` will connect to storage and save this change accordingly. Also, UI will detect this change
and refresh the whole patient list with the new appointment added.

### 2. Uploading Medical file for a Patient
This feature servers as one of the core features of MediMate, so how is it implemented?

* There are two ways to upload medical files for a patient within the application. 
* Users can either utilize a command (similar to 1.Marking Appointment using UploadFileCommand) or click the `upload button` in the user interface.
* Medical files should be in PDF, JPG, or PNG format, and can contain additional information about the patient, such as medical history, test results, or treatment plans.
* This section will delve deeper into the implementation of the file uploading functionality when the user click `upload button` which calls the `FileManager` object.

This feature is achieved by the following classes:
* `FileManager` - offers an `addFile` method that is invoked by `UploadFileCommand` and the `upload button`
* `FileStorage` - offers an `uploadFile` method that is invoked by `addFile` method in `FileManager`


Initially, when user clicks the `upload button`, FileManger is initialised with the given `Person` Object and `addFile` method is called thus invoking `uploadFile` method.
* The uploadFile() method uses the `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()` method to ensure that it runs on the `Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)` for proper GUI interaction.
* Within the `invokeLater()` method, a `JFileChooser` object is created and configured using the `configFileChooser()` method. The file chooser is set to allow multiple files selections and filter files based on their extensions: PDF, JPG, JPEG, and PNG.
* The file chooser dialog is displayed, and the user can select multiple files. The method then checks if the user has approved the file selection.
* If the user has approved the file selection, an array of selected files is obtained. The target directory path is created using the `"reports/{username}/"` format, where `{username}` is replaced with the username of the current user.
* If the file meets the requirements, it is copied to the target directory. `Existing files with the same name in the target directory are replaced`. If a file has an `unsupported extension` or `exceeds the maximum file size`, an `IOException` is thrown with a relevant error message.
* After successfully uploading all the allowed files, a `success message` is displayed to the user through a `JOptionPane`.

<img src="images/uploadFile.png" width="600" />

### 3. Create medical certificate PDF file
This feature servers as one of the core features of MediMate, so how is it implemented?

* There are two ways to create medical certificate for a patient within the application.
  Users can either utilize a command (similar to 1.Marking Appointment using CreateCommand ) or click the `create button` in the user interface.
* PDF file generated will be a copy of [`MC.pdf`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/MC.pdf).
* External API: [`pdfbox-app-2.027`](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) is used to read and write [`MC.pdf`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/MC.pdf).
* This section will delve deeper into the implementation of the medical certificate creation functionality when the user click `create button` filling up with correct information and called the `FileManager` object.

This feature is achieved by the following classes:
* `FileManager` - offers an `generateMc` method that is invoked by `CreateCommand` and the `create button`
* `PdfGenerator` - offers an `generate` method that is invoked by `generateMC` method in `FileManager`

After the user click `create button` and filled up with the correct information (doctor name, medical condition, and days), `FileManger` is initialised with the given `Person` Object and `generateMc` method is called invoking `generate` method.
* The generate method creates a customized Medical Certificate (MC) PDF for a patient by loading a template, filling in the form fields, saving the filled form with a unique filename, updating the patient's medical condition, and displaying a success message.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* private doctor or doctor's receptionist
* requires to manage large amount of patients details
* wants to organise and access patients data easily
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
The problem addressed is to assist in digitizing patient details. By converting traditional paper records into
electronic ones, healthcare providers can easily and efficiently organize and manage patient data.
This not only saves time and reduces the risk of errors, but it also makes it easier to retrieve and update the
information when needed.
Additionally, with the use of electronic scheduling systems, healthcare providers can easily schedule and reschedule
appointments, improving the overall experience for both patients and staff.
Overall, digitizing patient details helps to improve the quality of care and make the healthcare delivery process more
streamlined and efficient.
