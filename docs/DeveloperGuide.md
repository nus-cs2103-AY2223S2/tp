## 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

**Note**:
- Above describes the UI component for the `PersonList`.
- For our `TaskList`, the way it works is the same, but `Model` is changed to `TaskBookModel`, and `Person` is changed to `Task`.

## 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

**Note**:
- Our app also has a `TaskBook`, which works the same as `AddressBook`, except that it interacts with the classes that handle tasks, such as `TaskBookModel` and `DeleteTaskCommandParser`.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

**API** : [`TaskBookModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/TaskBookModel.java)

<img src="images/TaskModelClassDiagram.png" width="500" />


The `Model` component,

* stores all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as
an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own
without depending on other components)

:information_source: **Note:**Tasks are handled in a similar way in the `TaskBookModel` component. It interacts with components like `UniqueTaskList` and is 'observed' as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Role` list in Pied Piper, which `Person` references. This allows `Pied Piper` to only require one `Role` object per unique role, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Role` objects.<br>

##  3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />


The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `TaskStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

# 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## 4.1 Feature implementations

### 4.1.1 Add Task feature

The implementation of the add task function is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It takes user input depending on the task user wants to add.<br>
- For a `todo` task, the user input consists of 2 arguments, the command word being "todo". The second argument is a description of the task.
- For a `deadline` task, the user input consists of 3 arguments, the command word being "deadline". The second argument is a description of the task, and the third argument is the deadline of the task.
- For an `event` task, the user input consists of 4 arguments, the command word being "event". The second argument is a description of the task, the third argument is the start date of the task, and the fourth argument is the end date of the task.


The format is as follows:
- `todo task/TASK_DESCRIPTION`
- `deadline task/TASK_DESCRIPTION by/DEADLINE`
- `event task/TASK_DESCRIPTION from/START_DATE to/END_DATE`

Given below is an example scenario and how the adding task function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `todo task/organise pantry` command to add the task in Pied Piper. The command is read by `LogicManager`, which parses the user's input into a `commandText`.

Step 2. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommand` on the commandText in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` then uses `Matcher` to group the commandText into `commandWord` and `arguments`.

Step 4. A `ToDoCommandParser` is created, which generates a new `toAdd:Task` and a new `ToDoCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` then calls `execute` in `ToDoCommand`, which carries out the addition if the task is valid. It then returns a `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user to acknowledge whether the addition has taken place.

<i>Similarly, the above implementation applies to `deadline` and `event` tasks but with different arguments.</i>

:information_source: **Note:**The command can only work if a task with the same description is not already present in Pied Piper. Additionally, the above implmentation comes with the `edittask` feature, which allows the user to edit the details of a task in the task book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the addition operation works for a `TodoTask`:

<img src="images/ToDoSequenceDiagramUML.png"/>

The following sequence diagram shows how the addition operation works for a `DeadlineTask`:

<img src="images/DeadlineSequenceDiagramUML.png"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 4.1.2 Add Person feature

The implementation of the add person function is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It takes user input as 5 arguments, the command word being either `add`. The second argument is the `name`, the third argument is the `phone number`, the fourth argument is the `email`, and the fifth argument is the `address`. The `role` argument is optional and can be added by adding the argument `r/ROLE`.


The format is as follows:
- `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/ROLE]`

Given below is an example scenario and how the adding person function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/Jane Roe p/98123456 e/janer@nus.com a/Jane street, block 321 r/Member` command to add the person in Pied Piper address book. The command is read by `LogicManager`, which parses the user's input into a `commandText`.

Step 2. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommand` on the commandText in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` then uses `Matcher` to group the commandText into `commandWord` and `arguments`.

Step 4. A `AddCommandParser` is created, which generates a new `toAdd:Person` and a new `AddCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` then calls `execute` in `AddCommand`, which carries out the addition if the person details aer valid. It then returns a `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user to acknowledge whether the addition has taken place.

:information_source: **Note:**The command can only work if a task with the same details is not already present in Pied Piper. Additionally, the above implmentation comes with the `edit` feature, which allows the user to edit the details of a person in the address book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the addition operation works:

<img src="images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram.png"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 4.1.3 Delete/deletetask feature

The implementation of the delete/deletetask function is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It takes user input as 2 arguments, the command word being either `delete` or `deletetask`, depending on whether the user wants to delete a person or task respectively. The second argument is an index, denoting the index of the person or task the user wishes to delete.

The format is as follows:
- `delete PERSON_INDEX`
- `deletetask TASK_INDEX`

Given below is an example scenario and how the delete function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `deletetask 1` command to delete the 5th task in Pied Piper. The command is read by `LogicManager`, which parses the user's input into a `commandText`.

Step 2. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommand` on the commandText in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` then uses `Matcher` to group the commandText into `commandWord` and `arguments`.

Step 4. A `DeleteTaskCommandParser` is created, which generated a new `DeleteTaskCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` then calls `execute` in `DeleteTaskCommand`, which carries out the deletion if the task exists. It then returns a `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user to acknowledge whether the deletion has taken place.

:information_source: **Note:**The command can only work if there is at least 1 person or task present in Pied Piper, and the specified index must not be greater than the index of the last item on the list.
In case of deleting a person, all the tasks assigned to that particular person must be handled (unassigned). The same sequence as above applies to the deletion of a person from address book, but the following classes are different:
1. `DeleteTaskCommandParser` &rarr; `DeleteCommandParser`
2. `DeleteTaskCommand` &rarr; `DeleteCommand`

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

<img src="images/DeleteCommandUML.png"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 4.1.4 Assign Task feature

The implementation of the assign function is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It takes user input as 3 arguments, 
the command word being `assign`. The second argument is an task index, denoting the index of task the user wishes to assign.
The third argument is an person index, denoting the index of the person the task is supposed to be assigned.

The format is as follows:
- `assign t/TASK_INDEX i/PERSON_INDEX`

Given below is an example scenario and how the assign function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `assign t/1 i/2` command to assign the first task in Pied Piper to second person in the address book. 
The command is read by `LogicManager`, which parses the user's input into a `commandText`.

Step 2. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommand` on the commandText in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` then uses `Matcher` to group the commandText into `commandWord` and `arguments`.

Step 4. A `AssignTaskCommandParser` is created, which generated a new `AssignTaskCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` then calls `execute` in `AssignTaskCommand`, which carries out the functionality of the command.
This method creates a new `Task` object with the same description as the task to be assigned, but with the person assigned to it. 
This new instance of `Task` is then replaced with the existing instance in the `UniqueTaskList` in `TaskBook`. 
It then returns a `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user to acknowledge whether the assignment has taken place.

:information_source: **Note:**Multiple tasks can be assigned to a single person. 
The command can only work if the person to be assigned has been given a role. 


The following sequence diagram shows how the assignment operation works:

<img src="images/AssignSequenceDiagram.png"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 4.1.5 Mark/Unmark Task feature

The implementation of the mark function is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It takes user input as 3 arguments, 
the command word being `mark`. The second argument is an task index, denoting the index of task the user wishes to mark as complete.
The third argument is an score, denoting the score of the task alloted by the leader.
<br>
On the other hand, the implementation of the unmark function takes user input as 2 arguments, 
the command word being `unmark`. The second argument is an task index, denoting the index of task the user wishes to mark as incomplete.

The format is as follows:
- `mark t/TASK_INDEX s/PERFORMANCE_SCORE`
- `unmark t/TASK_INDEX`

Given below is an example scenario and how the mark function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `mark t/1 s/3` command to mark the first task in Pied Piper as complete with a score of 3. 
The command is read by `LogicManager`, which parses the user's input into a `commandText`.

Step 2. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommand` on the commandText in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `AddressBookParser` then uses `Matcher` to group the commandText into `commandWord` and `arguments`.

Step 4. A `MarkCommandParser` is created, which generated a new `MarkCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` then calls `execute` in `MarkCommand`, which carries out the functionality of the command.
This method creates a new `Task` object with the same description as the task to be marked, but with the status marked as complete.
This new instance of `Task` is then replaced with the existing instance in the `UniqueTaskList` in `TaskBook`. 
It then returns a `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user to acknowledge whether the task has been marked as complete.

:information_source: **Note:**Any task cannot be marked if it not assigned to a person. Additionally, the user can mark the task again to give a different score. The score will be updated to the new score.
The implemention of the unmark function is similar to the mark function, except that the status of the task is marked as incomplete.


The following sequence diagram shows how the mark/unmark operation works:

<img src="images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 4.1.6 Review feature

The implementation of the mark function is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It takes user input as 1 arguments, 
the command word being `review`.

The format is as follows:
- `review`

Given below is an example scenario and how the review function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `review` command to mark the first task in Pied Piper as complete with a score of 3. 
The command is read by `LogicManager`, which parses the user's input into a `commandText`.

Step 2. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommand` on the commandText in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 4. A `ReviewCommand` is created.

Step 5. `LogicManager` then calls `execute` in `ReviewCommand`, which carries out the functionality of the command.
This method goes through the `UniqueTaskList` in `TaskBook` and checks for any tasks that are marked as complete, or score is not given. After, it checks for any tasks that are assigned to a person and calculates the average score of the tasks assigned to each person.
It then returns a `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user to acknowledge whether the averge score of each person has been calculated.

The following sequence diagram shows how the review operation works:

<img src="images/ReviewSequenceDiagram.png"/>

### 4.1.7 STATUS feature

The implementation of the status feature is facilitated by the `setTaskStatus` method of `TaskCard`.
It sets the STATUS UI element to a specific colour depending on the status of the task.

A sequence of steps are followed:

Step 1: **Start**

Step 2: colour is set to it's default value: black.

Step 3: `setTaskStatus` sets the colour to green if the task is marked as done. **End**.

Step 4: Otherwise it sets the colour to orange if the task is due today. **End**.

Step 5: Otherwise it sets the colour to red if the task is over due. **End**.

Step 6: If an error is thrown the colour is set to it's default colour: black. **End**.


The following activity diagram shows how the colour is set:

<img src="images/StatusActivityDiagram.png"/>

## 4.2 Proposed implementation of future features:

**Aspect: How to undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Aspect: How to sort my tasks/members:**

* **Proposed Implementation (current choice):** Display a temporary list of tasks/members sorted by the user's preference.
  * Pros: Better user experience.
  * Cons: Difficult to implement in terms of memory usage and different criterias for sorting.
