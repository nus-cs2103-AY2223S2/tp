### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.1.1</b> Architecture diagram for high-design of the App
</div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Manage the HMHero application User Interface
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Manage the execution of commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Alex p/91234567`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.1.2</b> Sequence Diagram for the command <code>delete n/Alex p/91234567</code>
</div>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.

* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)


For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.1.3</b> Class Diagram for Component Managers
</div>

The sections below give more details of each component.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.2.1</b> Class Diagram for UI Components
</div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. 

Steps to start making changes to the UI:
1. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the [`src/main/resources/view`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view) folder.
2. The managing classes of these UI parts are defined in matching `.java` files in the [`src/main/java/seedu/address/ui`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui) folder.
3. The stylesheets for these UI parts can be found in `Extensions.css`, `HMHero.css`, and `Mainwindow.css`, except `UserProfilePanel` and `HelpWindow` with separate CSS files in matching `.css` files in the [`src/main/resources/view`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view) folder.
4. For instance, the layout of the `HelpWindow` is specified in [`HelpWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml) with managing class at [`HelpWindow.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindow.java) and CSS file at [`HelpWindow.css`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.css).
 

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.3.1</b> Class diagram for Logic Components
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `HMHeroParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete n/John p/91234567")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/John p/91234567` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.3.2</b> Sequence Diagram for the command <code>delete n/Alex p/91234567</code>
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.3.3</b> Class diagram for Parser Components
</div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `HMHero` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `HMHeroParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.4.1</b> Class diagram for Model Component
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Note` list in the `HMHero`, which `Person` references. This allows `HMHero` to only require one `Note` object per unique note, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Note` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


</div>

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 1.5.1</b> Class diagram for Storage Components
</div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `HMHeroStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

#### Adding an Applicant 

##### Overview

The `add` command creates a new `Person`, which represents an Applicant in HMHero's Applicant Managing System.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:</strong>
`add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [applied/APPLIEDDATETIME] [note/NOTE]...` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `add` command:

![AddCommand activity diagram](images/AddApplicantActivityDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. The user specifies Applicants details to create. Compulsory fields are name, phone, address, and email. Optional
fields include application date time and notes about the applicant.
2. If any of the compulsory fields are not provided, or the provided inputs are in the wrong format, an error message
   will be displayed. The user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via the error message.
3. All applicants added will start at the Applied Status.
4. If application date time was not provided, HMHero would assume the application date time of the Applicant to be now
   (the current date and time on the user's computer)
5. The applicant is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it already exists. If it does, an error is raised
to inform the user.
6. If step 5 completes without any exceptions, the new `Person` is created and stored inside HMHero.

##### Feature Considerations

When checking for duplicates in the `UniquePersonList` inside `Model`, any `Person` cannot have the same name and phone
as another. HMHero checks for both the name and phone number when checking for duplicates to prevent the situation of
applicants having the same name.

When implementing this feature, we restricted users to only add applicants into the `APPLIED` status. This is because
we wanted HMHero to adhere to the flow of the hiring process. Allowing users to add applicants into specific statuses
could introduce confusion to how `add` command is used.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Advancing an Applicant

##### Overview

The `advance` command advances an `Person` in HMHero, which advances the `Status` of a `Person`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:</strong>
`advance n/NAME p/PHONE [d/INTERVIEWDATETIME]` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format and applicant status.
</div>

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `advance` command:
![Advance activity diagram](images/AdvanceActivityDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details
1. The user specifies an applicant name and phone that represents a `Person` to be advanced.
2. If the name and phone is not provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to
enter the command correctly via an error message.
3. The name and phone are cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if an applicant with the corresponding name and phone exists. If it does not, then an error is raised to inform the user.
4. The status must be either Applied or Shortlisted. Else, then an error is raised to inform the user.
5. If the interview datetime is not provided when the status is Applied, the user will be prompted to enter the command
correctly via an error message.
6. If the interview datetime provided exists in the `Model`, the user will be prompted to enter the command
correctly via an error message.
7. If the interview datetime is provided when the status is Shortlisted, the user will be prompted to enter the command
correctly via an error message.
8. If step 7 is reached without any error message, HMHero advances the specified `Person`'s `Status`.

##### Feature Considerations

When implementing this feature, we realised that we could model HMHero to track hiring process in the real world 
more effectively by enforcing the rule that the user can only advance applicants one stage at a time. 
We thus decided to provide a default behaviour when advancing an applicant's status.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Rejecting an Applicant

##### Overview

The `reject` command rejects a `Person` in HMHero, which changes the `status` of a `Person` to `REJECTED`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:</strong>
`reject n/NAME p/PHONE` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `reject` command:

![RejectApplicantActivityDiagram](images/RejectApplicantActivityDiagram.png)


##### Feature Details
1. The user specifies an applicant name and phone that represents an `Person` to be rejected.
2. If the name and phone is not provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to
enter the command correctly via an error message.
3. The name and phone are cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if an applicant with the corresponding name and phone exists.
    If it does not, then an error is raised to inform the user.
4. HMHero confirms that the applicant's status is not already `REJECTED`. Else, an error is raised to inform the user.
5. If step 4 completes without any exceptions, then the `Person` is successfully rejected.

##### Feature Considerations

While it may be feasible to implement the `reject` command to successfully execute on 
applicants with `REJECTED` status, we felt that throwing an error message would provide more value for the user to 
inform them that the applicant has already been rejected. <br>
Additionally, we realised that it is common for hiring managers to reject applicants without removing them. Thus, the
`reject` command does not perform the same functionality as the `delete` command.
We also allowed the rejecting of applicants with the `ACCEPTED` status for the rare case where users might want to
reject an accepted applicant due to an unforeseen circumstance.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Finding an Applicant

##### Overview

The `find` command filters applicants based on fields specified by the user. 
Fields have to be denoted by flags. Allowed fields for filtering are `name` and `phone`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:</strong>
`find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE]` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:</strong>
`find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE]` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `find` command:

![FindCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram for `find n/John` in HMHero is as such:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Info:</strong>
The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of <strong>PlantUML</strong>, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.
Additionally, take note that interactions with utility classes such as `ArgumentTokenizer`, `ArgumentMultimap`, and `Messages` are excluded as including them would cause the UML diagram to be cluttered and too small to read.
</div>

##### Feature Details
1. The user specifies one or more fields to filter through the applicant list.
2. If the user specifies more than one field, the filtered applicant list has to match all fields.
3. If the user specifies a field more than once, only the last argument is considered when filtering applicants.

##### Feature considerations
The UI displays a `FilteredList` obtained from an immutable applicant list.
The `FindCommandParser` creates the `Predicate` used to filter the applicant list. When the `FindCommand` is executed,
the `FilteredList` sets its `Predicate` field to the created `Predicate`. The UI shows the new `FilteredList`.

Applicant fields are required as an input as it is helpful to reduce user confusion and facilitate finding applicants based on multiple fields.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Editing an Applicant

##### Overview

The `edit` feature edits the attached attributes of a specified `Person`,which is specified by the one-indexed `personList` presented to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

:information_source: <strong>Command Format:</strong>
`edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/INTERVIEWDATETIME] [note/NOTE]...` <br>
Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more information on Command format.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `edit` command:

![EditApplicantActivityDiagram](images/EditApplicantActivityDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. The user can perform commands that modify the shown applicant list. (Eg. `find` and `interview` commands)
2. The user specifies an index that represents a `Person` to be edited.
3. If a non-zero unsigned integer index is not provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
4. At least one field to be edited has to be provided. Else, the user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
5. If an index that is not in the valid range of the list is provided, an error is thrown and the user is prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
6. The `edit` command creates a new applicant based on the given fields. The created applicant is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it already exists. If it already does, then an error is raised to inform the user.
7. If step 6 completes without any exceptions, then the `Person` at the specified index is successfully edited.

##### Feature Considerations

Similar to the `add` command, it should be noted that when checking for duplicates in the `UniquePersonList` inside the
`Model`, Applicants cannot have the same name and phone number. For example, if a `Person` with the name `Thomas` and
phone number `91823452` already exists inside the list, then you cannot edit an existing `Person` to have the name `Thomas` and
phone number `91823452`.

When providing multiple arguments with the same delimiter,
the last instance of the repeat delimiter is taken during the `parse` command.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Displaying the list

##### Overview
The `list` command displays the full list by HMHero.

Here is the activity diagram showing the process of the `list` command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

##### Feature Details

1. The user calls the `list` command.
2. HMHero performs the necessary calculations to obtain the statistics. HMHero displays the result to the user.

##### Feature Considerations

The statistics of the number of applicants in each stage of the application cycle were chosen as a baseline, 
and they are a good starting point for users to help track the number of applicants. 
For example, the user can obtain the total number of applicants, 
and also provide the total numbers of applicants for each status.

#### Filter applicants based on notes

1. The user calls the `skill` command.
2. The applicant list is filtered for applicants with notes that match the keyword provided.
3. HMHero displays the filtered applicant list to the user.

We limited the length of the keyword to a maximum of 45 characters because the longest word in the English dictionary
has a length of 45 characters so there is no reason for the keyword to have a length longer than that.

## **Effort**

It was not easy to develop HMHero. Our team struggled with ways to make our product unique and stand out from existing products in the market,
while at the same time ensuring that this product could be completed in the short span of time given.

### Managing Tasks

While working on this project, our team was also occupied with other modules that we were juggling throughout the semester. 
Hence, it was not easy carving out time every week to meet with the team, apart from the scheduled weekly meetings.
Some weeks required more than one meeting, and we had to work around the different clashes in timetables between each team members.
However, we are grateful for the effort that every member has put in to make this project a success and meet our expectations.

### Improved UI
The original AB3 program only displayed the list of persons which is not very useful for an application tracking applicants. 
To make our app effective, we enhanced the output command box to include information of each applicant for each command that is associated with the specific applicant. 
This makes it easier for the user to track the status of their applicants as they execute their commands.

In terms of colour scheme, we thought that the dark theme of AB3 was uninspiring and made use of own blue and light colored theme to give this app a nice, warm and welcoming feel.

### Extensive Testing

The increased number of classes, along with all the commands, means that code coverage is likely to decrease and more testing had to be done as compared to that in AB3.

Hence, we took it as an opportunity to do extensive testing for our application through writing effective unit tests for our commands, 
parsers and model objects. We redesigned how testing is done for commands and manage to cover all commands successfully. 
We achieved a ~86% code coverage from the original ~72% in AB3, and increased the number of test cases from 248 (in AB3) to 301 (in HMHero).

## **Planned Enhancements**

1. Allowing a command specific to adding of notes to an applicant. Our current implementation requires for the user to re-key every single note that was already registered in HMHero when trying to 
edit the applicant and adding extra notes to the applicant. This may be very cumbersome and troublesome for the user especially if the applicant already has a long list of notes registered.
2. Enhancing commands involving date time inputs to check for invalid date inputs for specific months. For example, `31-02-2023` is an invalid date for the month of February.
However, with Java's LocalDateTime class, it does not see this as an invalid LocalDateTime class but instead automatically refactors this date to `28-02-2023`, without notifying the user.
This would be better if an error message is thrown to alert the user of this automatic change instead of silently changing it without notifying the user. Note that an error is still thrown for obvious invalid dates
such as `32-02-2023`, but just not for the case of specific dates that may be valid in certain months but invalid for other months.
3. Enhancing the `edit` command to check for changing an interview date to a date in the past should throw a warning to alert the user that the edited interview date time is in the past. This should not be the case
when the user edits the interview date time of an applicant and hence should be warned to the user, but still allow the change to execute.
4. Enhancing the GUI to show more information such as the Application DateTime of an applicant more easily instead of having to execute a command to view information. 
Currently out GUI hides these information and is only available for the user after the user executes a relevant command that changes these information. This might be inconvenient for users and is a room for improvement
in future enhancements.
5. Enhancing the `add` and `edit` command to warn the user if duplicate phone numbers are used in the new or edited entries. While phone numbers are unique, there is the slight possibility that a new applicant is using the phone number 
of an old applicant (who has changed his/her phone number). Hence, we shall not deny these commands to throw an error but rather we should warn the user when these commands are executed so that the user aware of it.
6. Adding a feature that allows for importing of csv files so that users can transfer existing data into HMHero, instead of having to re-key all the existing entries
manually into HMHero at the start.
7. Enhancing the `summary` command to produce useful charts and graphs for Hiring Managers to have a better visualisation of the hiring process.
8. Enhancing the checking of emails to have a valid domain name such as `@gmail.com` or `@nus.edu.sg` instead of just checking for the presence of `@` in the email.
9. Advancing of applicants should apply for cases where there are multiple rounds of interview. So we should also allow for multiple stages of `SHORTLISTED`.
Hence when advancing a `SHORTLISTED` applicant, the applicant can be advanced into the next stage of `SHORTLISTED` instead of immediately to `ACCEPTED`.
