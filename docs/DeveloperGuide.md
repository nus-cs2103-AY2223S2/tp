### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePerson 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `BookListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Book` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ExpressLibraryParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletePerson 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletePerson 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ExpressLibraryParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `ExpressLibraryParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the ExpressLibrary data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Book` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueBookList`).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. Similar process for `Book` objects as well.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ExpressLibrary`, which `Person` references. This allows `ExpressLibrary` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both express library data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ExpressLibraryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `expresslibrary.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Borrow/return feature

#### Implementation

The borrow feature will allow the user to mark a book as borrowed by a person.
Similarly, the return feature will allow the user to mark a book as returned to the ExpressLibrary by a person.

It implements the following commands:

* `borrow PERSON_INDEX b/BOOK_INDEX d/DUE_DATE`
* `return PERSON_INDEX b/BOOK_INDEX`

Given below is an example usage scenario of the borrow command:

The user executes `borrow 1 b/2 d/23/11/2023` command to lend the 2nd book in the book list to the 1st person in the Person list.

The `BorrowCommand` class will first retrieve the `Person` object and `Book` object from the given indexes and create a copy of them (since they are immutable) called `editedPerson` and `bookToBorrow`.

Then, it calls `borrowBook` on `editedPerson` and passes in the `Book` object `bookToBorrow`. This will add the book to the person's `Set` of `books` field. Similarly, the class also calls `loanBookTo` on `bookToBorrow` to update the book's fields with the borrower, the borrow date (current date) and the due date details.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the return command:

The user executes `return 2 b/1` command to return the 1st book in the book list from the 2nd person in the person list.

The `ReturnCommand` class will first retrieve the `Person` object and `Book` object from the given indexes and create a copy of them (since they are immutable) called `editedPerson` and `bookToReturn`.

Then, it calls `returnBook` on `editedPerson` and passes in the `Book` object `bookToReturn`. This will remove the book from the Person's `Set` of books field. Similarly, the class also calls `returnBook` on `bookToReturn` to update and remove the person from the book's borrower field as well as clear the borrow and due dates.

### Find book feature

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findBook` command progresses from step to step.

Step 1. The user launches the app and enters `findBook The` command to look for any books with the keyword `The` in its title (non case-sensitive). `MainWindow#executeCommand()` is called, which passes the control over to the Logic component by calling `LogicManager#execute()`.

Step 2. `ExpressLibraryParser#parseCommand` is called to parse the given `findBook` command text, which calls `FindBookCommandParser#parse` to further parse `findBook` command text. This ultimately produces a `FindBookCommand` object. The logic manager then calls `FindBookCommand#execute` on the new object which passes control to the `Model` component.

Step 3. `FindBookCommand#execute` will call `Model#updateFilteredBookList` to update the `FilteredList` of books which is then reflected in the UI because `BookListPanel#BookListPanel()` constructor sets `BookListPanel.fxml` to be constantly viewing the book list. The `Model` component then passes control back to the Logic component.

Step 4. `FindBookCommand#execute` returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManager#execute`, which then passes control back to the UI component.

Step 5. `MainWindow#executeCommand` then uses the `CommandResult` to display feedback to the user on the UI which states: “{Number of books that match keyword} books found!”

The following sequence diagram shows how the `findBook` operation works:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Has a need to manage a significant number of books and library users.
* Has a need to quickly access a particular book or person.
* Has a need to track if due dates of books borrowed are approaching/expired.
* Can type fast.
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions.
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps.

**Value proposition**: Manage users and books faster, quickly find users or books faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

2. Dealing with corrupted data files.

   1. Prerequisites: `expresslibrary-{version_num}.json` should exist in `[JAR file location]/data`. If it does not exist, launch ExpressLibrary and use any command that will change the data of the ExpressLibrary (e.g. `addBook`, `borrow`, etc.) and the `expresslibrary-{version_num}.json` file will be automatically generated.

   1. To simulate a corrupted file, go to `[JAR file location]/data/expresslibrary-{version_num}.json` and make changes so that the file would be invalid (e.g. remove a comma/bracket).

   Expected: Launch ExpressLibrary and you should see that ExpressLibrary will be empty.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** Advanced users of ExpressLibrary are welcome to manually edit the data file if they wish to do so. Please refer to [_How data is saved_](UserGuide.html#how-data-is-saved).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Given below are some of the planned enhancements to ExpressLibrary current features.

1. Currently all ExpressLibrary fields do not have any character limit, resulting in extreme inputs being truncated in the GUI. We plan to set an appropriate character limit for each field in order to counteract this and wrap the fields if the GUI cannot fit the fields in one line.

2. Currently each person can borrow an unlimited books, we plan to fix this by limiting the number of books a person can borrow in a future update.

3. Currently, ExpressLibrary assumes that there is only one copy of each book in the library which is obviously quite unrealistic. We plan to solve this by creating a BookInstance class in the future to account for different copies of the same book in the library.

4. Email addresses are only validated based on regex (specifically RFC5322 standard) and not whether it is actually a valid email. We plan to use internationalised domain names in a future update in order to truly validate an email address.
