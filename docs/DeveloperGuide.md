Introducing **MediConnect** - the hospital management application designed to  **streamline patient management,
doctor coordination, and hospital billing.** As a centralised platform, **MediConnect** offers healthcare
professionals and administrative staff an efficient solution to manage administrative matters in local clinics.
The app simplifies the organization and maintenance of patient and doctor data, appointments and billing records. <br>
**MediConnect** can be used with either a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).<br>

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete ic/S9876543K`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddDoctorCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a doctor).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete ic/S9876543K")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete ic/S9876543K` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddDoctorCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddDoctorCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddDoctorCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

#### Person

* The `Person` object under the `Model` component, stores information of a generic person
* A `Person` object extends a `Patient` or a `Doctor`, which stores information specific to a patient and a doctor respectively
* Note that only the `Nric` uniquely identifies each `Person`

#### Appointment

* The `Appointment` object is stored within the `Appointment` package, under the `Model` component.
* Stores the required information of an appointment, including patient's `Nric`, `Booking`, and doctor's `Nric`
  * Note that the patient's `Nric` and doctor's `Nric` has to exist in `MediConnect`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Prescription

* The `Prescription` object is stored within the `Prescription` package, under the `Model` component.
* Stores the required information of a prescription, including `Cost`, and `Medication`
    * Note that `Prescription` can only be created for an existing `Patient` in `MediConnect`

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a Person

The add mechanism is facilitated by `MediConnect`.

It allows the user to add new a person (Patient/Doctor) to the `list` using `addPatient` or `addDoctor`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `MediConnect` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.
All existing patients and doctors are shown as an indexed list.

Step 2. The user inputs the appropriate command (either addPatient or addDoctor), followed by the required input fields as shown below: <br>
`addDoctor n/Sarah Tan p/99123456 e/sarah@abc.com ic/T7654321P a/Sarah Rd t/Pediatrician`

Step 3. The `addDoctorCommandParser` checks whether all the required fields are present and correct. If all fields are correct it creates a new `addDoctorCommand`.

Step 4. The `addDoctorCommand` checks if the person does not already exist in the list.

Step 5. The `addDoctorCommand` calls `Model#addDoctor()`, which adds the doctor to the `UniquePersonList` in `ModelManager`.

Step 6. `MediConnect` will store the updated list in Storage and display the new doctor in the Ui.

The following sequence diagram shows how the addDoctor mechanism works:

![addDoctorSequenceDiagram](images/AddDoctorSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspects**

Command Format:
1. Option 1 (Current Choice): Have separate commands for adding patients and doctors.
   * Pros: Easier implementation, Clearly defined use
   * Cons: Increasing number of commands might lead to confusion
2. Option 2: Have one `addCommand` and let the user specify the person's role.
   * Pros: Easy to remember
   * Cons: Harder to implement, The command would be too long

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a Person

The delete mechanism is facilitated by `MediConnect`. It extends `MediConnect` with a delete function.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `MediConnect` will be initialized with the initial list state, with a sample list of names.

![deleteState0](images/deleteState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes addDoctor n/David â€¦â€‹ to add a new doctor. The NRIC of the doctor is also included.

![deleteState1](images/deleteState1.png)

Step 3. The user now wants to delete the person, and decides to carry out the delete operation by executing the `delete` command.

Step 4. The user executes `delete ic/S9876543K` command to delete the person with the `NRIC S9876543K` in the MediConnect. The `delete` command removes the person with the corresponding `NRIC` from the current list.

![deleteState2](images/deleteState2.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How delete executes:**

* **Current choice:** Delete the patient/doctor with the given NRIC
    * Pros: Easy to implement. No need to worry about multiple people with same name, since everyone has a unique nric number.
    * Cons: Cannot delete multiple people at once. User might delete the wrong nric accidentally since it is a long chain of numbers.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Display feature

The display feature is to allow the user to view all detailed particulars of a `Patient` or `Doctor`. Note that the `Person` has to exist in `MediConnect`.  This feature is intended to complement the `Edit`, `Appointment` and `Prescription` features, allowing users to access all of the `Person`'s information when updating records.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display mechanism behaves at each step.

Scenario: Mary Smith is a patient (already registered in the system) who has just arrived at the clinic for her appointment. She is required to register her visit before consulting the doctor.

Step 1. The healthcare administrative staff wishes to verify that Mary has an appointment scheduled at this time. The staff first verifies Mary Smith's `Nric` with her, and executes `display ic/S1234567X`. As seen from Mary's appointment list, an appointment is indeed scheduled for today, and the staff proceeds to register her visit.

The sequence diagram below shows how the DisplayCommand works:
![DisplaySequenceDiagram](images/DisplaySequenceDiagram.png)

* When the user inputs `display ic/[NRIC]`, the `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. This creates an `AppointmentCommandParser` to parse the person's `Nric` through `ParserUtil`
    * Any invalid inputs will throw a `ParseException`
* Otherwise, it creates an `DisplayCommand`. The `LogicManager` then executes the `DisplayCommand`, upon which the `Person` is retrieved by `Nric` before calling `Model#updatePersonView()` to display the detailed view of the retrieved `Person`
    * `CommandException` is thrown
        * if `Patient` or `Doctor` retrieved by `Nric` does not exist

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Appointment feature

`Appointment` represents a scheduled meeting between a `Patient` and a `Doctor`. When a `Patient` is scheduled an appointment with a `Doctor`, that corresponding `Doctor` will have an appointment scheduled with that particular `Patient`. Each `Appointment` consists of the following:
* Patient's `Nric` of the `Patient` scheduled for an appointment
* `Booking` consisting the date of the appointment
* Doctor's `Nric` of the `Doctor` that the `Patient` is scheduled with in the appointment

#### Adding an appointment

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add appointment mechanism behaves at each step.

Scenario: Mary Smith is an outpatient (already registered in the system) due for her medical check-up with Dr. Paul West (already registered in the system) in 2 weeks, on 01-02-2023 10:00. (Note: This scenario assumes that there is currently no existing appointment data that has been created or stored in MediConnect.)

Step 1. The healthcare administrative staff first verifies Mary Smith's `Nric` with her, and executes `appointment ic/S1234567X d/01-02-2023 10:00 dric/S7654321R` command to add an appointment for Mary Smith at the specified date, with Dr Paul West. This adds an `Appointment` to Mary, an`Appointment` to Dr. Paul, and an `Appointment` to the `HospitalAppointmentList`. The successful execution of the command confirms that both Mary Smith does not have any prior booking on this date and that Dr. Paul West is not scheduled to meet any other patients on the same date.

The sequence diagram below shows how the AppointmentCommand works:
![AppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

* When the user inputs `appointment ic/[NRIC] d/[DATE] dric/[NRIC]`, the `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. This creates an `AppointmentCommandParser` to parse the patient's `Nric`, `Booking`, and doctor's `Nric` inputs through `ParserUtil`
  * Any invalid inputs will throw a `ParseException`
* Otherwise, it creates an `AppointmentCommand` with the new `Appointment` created. The `LogicManager` then executes the `AppointmentCommand`, upon which the `Appointment` is added to the `Patient` and `Doctor`'s appointment list, as well as the `Model` by calling `ModelManager#bookAppointment()`.
  * `CommandException` is thrown
    * if `Patient` or `Doctor` retrieved by `Nric` does not exist, or
    * if `Appointment` already exists in `Model`
* Since the `Patient` and `Doctor`'s `Appointment` attributes have been updated, new instances of `Patient` and `Doctor` are created, and saved with `Model#setPerson()`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Deleting an appointment

The sequence diagram below shows how the `DeleteAppointmentCommand` is parsed:
{add a sequence diagram}

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete appointment mechanism behaves at each step.

Scenario: Mary Smith already has a medical check-up scheduled with Dr. Paul West (already registered in the system) on 01-02-2023 10:00. However, she realizes that she cannot make it and wishes to cancel the appointment. (Note: This scenario assumes that there is currently no existing appointment data that has been created or stored in MediConnect.)

Step 1. The healthcare administrative staff first verifies Mary Smith's `Nric` with her, and executes `display ic/S1234567X` to view all her existing appointment bookings. This displays Mary's list of appointments, and the appointment that needs to be cancelled is located at index 1.

Step 2. The user executes `deleteAppointment 1 ic/S1234567X` command to delete the appointment at index 1 of Mary's list of appointments. This removes the `Appointment` from Mary's and Dr. Paul's appointment list, and from `HospitalAppointmentList`.

The sequence diagram below shows how the DeleteAppointmentCommand works:
![DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* When the user inputs `deleteAppointment INDEX ic/[NRIC]`, the `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. This creates a `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` to parse the patient's `Nric`, and `INDEX` through `ParserUtil`
    * Any invalid inputs will throw a `ParseException`
* Otherwise, it creates a `DeleteAppointmentCommand`. The `LogicManager` then executes the `DeleteAppointmentCommand`, upon which the `Appointment` to be deleted is retrieved and removed from the `Patient` and `Doctor`'s appointment list, as well as the `Model` by calling `ModelManager#deleteAppointment()`.
    * `CommandException` is thrown
        * if `Patient` or `Doctor` retrieved by `Nric` does not exist, or
        * if `INDEX` is invalid
* Since the `Patient` and `Doctor`'s `Appointment` attributes have been updated, new instances of `Patient` and `Doctor` are created, and saved with `Model#setPerson()`

#### Design considerations:

* Aspect: Command format:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete appointment specified by the `INDEX`.
    * Pros: User can input a shorter command.
    * Cons: Can be tedious to find the appointment to delete if the appointment list gets very long.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete appointment specified by the `Booking` and doctor's `Nric`.
    * Pros: User does not have to search through the patient's appointment list to identify which appointment to delete.
    * Cons: More tedious to implement and less convenient for the user to input command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Prescribe Feature
`Prescription` refers to a `Medication` being sold at a `Cost`. Each `Patient` can have one or more `Prescriptions`
which can help generate their bill. There are a few ways to implement connecting these 4 classes, and we opted for
the one simplest for the User to use as our Users could be not tech-savvy.

#### Design considerations:
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Allow `Patient` to have direct access to `Prescription`, which encapsulates `Medication` and `Cost`.
  * Pros: Simpler to implement as it reuses existing code.
  * Cons: Duplicated information, if multiple `Patient` have the same `Prescription`.

![PrescriptionImplementationCurrent.png](images/PrescriptionImplementationCurrent.png)

* **Alternative 2:**  Allow `Patient` to have access to only `Medication`. And store the `Prescription` relationship of
`Medication` and `Cost` in a separate table.
  * Pros: This is the most object-oriented, and thus intuitive design. `Patient` is less coupled to `Cost`.
  * Cons: Most challenging design. Does not allow prescribing `Medication` at a different `Cost`, such as if the prices rise.

![PrescriptionImplementationAlternative.png](images/PrescriptionImplementationAlternative.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete ic/S9876543K` command to delete the person with the `NRIC S9876543K` in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete ic/S9876543K` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png" width="446" height="200" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Given below are the current known feature flaws and the plans the team have for them in the future versions.

1. The current GUI is not resizable. We plan to add new features; either a dashboard or graph to occupy the extra white space to make it more user-friendly.
2. The MediConnect currently does not accept name with symbols. We plan to implement that in the next version
3. Currently, prescriptions do not indicate the doctor that prescribe the medication. We realise this is an important feature to have and plan to implement it in the next version.
4. The find command currently does not update the display box after filtering the person. We plan to change this in the next version to automatically display the user information after finding the person in the next version.
5. Currently, MediConnect does not set the person's date of birth as a compulsory field. We plan to make the date of birth a compulsory field in the next version.
6. Currently, MediConnect does not check for case sensitivity and reads upper case and lower case items as separate items. We plan to allow MediConnect to ignore case sensitivity in the next version. For example, if Paracetmol and paracetamol can be prescribed to the same patient.
7. Currently, MediConnect does not limit the number of digits in a phone number. We plan to limit the maximum number of phone digits to 15 in the next version.
8. Currently, MediConnect only take note of the patient's current prescription but does not store a recorded history of the patient's past prescription. We plan to have a prescription history in the next version.
