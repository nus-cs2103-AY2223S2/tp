## **Overview**

GoodMatch (GM) is a **desktop app for managing applicants and job listings, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), specifically catering to HR managers in charge of tracking job listings across many platforms. If you can type fast, GM can get your applicant and job listing management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps

### Architecture

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" />
  
  <em>Architecture diagram for GoodMatch</em>
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Architecture sequence diagram for GoodMatch</em>
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/ComponentManagers.png" />
  <em>Sequence diagram for the Managers in GoodMatch</em>
</p>

###### _< Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) >_


### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Structure of the <code>UI</code> component</em>
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Listing` object residing in the `Model`.

###### _< Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) >_

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Structure of the <code>Logic</code> component</em>
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ListingBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a Listing).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Interactions inside the <code>Logic</code> component for the <code>delete 1</code> command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The lifeline for <code>UndoCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/ParserClasses.png" />
  <em>Class diagram for the <code>Parser</code> classes</em>
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ListingBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ListingBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

###### _< Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) >_

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Class diagram for the <code>Model</code> component</em>
</p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the listing book data i.e., all `Listing` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueListingList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Listing` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Listing>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user‚Äôs preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note** : An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a <code>Applicant</code> list in the <code>ListingBook</code>, which <code>Listing</code> references. This allows <code>ListingBook</code> to only require one <code>Applicant</code> object per unique applicant, instead of each <code>Listing</code> needing their own <code>Applicant</code> objects. Same goes for <code>Platform</code> objects.<br>
</div>

<p>

  <em>A better class diagram for the <code>Model</code> component</em>
</p>


###### _< Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) >_

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" />
  <em>Class diagram for the <code>Storage</code> component</em>
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both listing book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ListingBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes how features are implemented in GoodMatch in general. Detailed examples will be provided as well as specific details for noteworthy features.

### Overview

The basic idea for what happens when a user types a command and presses enter:
1. The CommandBox executes the command with `handleCommandEntered()` which does 2 things.
   1. Use `LogicManager` to execute the command.
      1. The `LogicManager` is in charge of parsing commands.
         1. Preliminary parsing is done by `ListingBookParser` to determine the type of command.
         2. Further parsing is done by `XYZCommandParser` if there are additional arguments to be parsed.
      2. The parsed command then communicates with the `ModelManager` to execute.
   2. Display the result from step 1.

For more detailed explanations and diagrams (sequence, partial class, and architecture diagrams) please refer to the [Design](#design) section above.

In GoodMatch, feature commands can be split into these categories:
1. Feature commands that only require a preliminary parsing.
   1. Commands like `help`, `exit`, `view`.
2. Feature commands that require further parsing which can be further categorised.
   1. Feature commands that modify ListingBook. (Basic features)
      1. Commands like `add`, `add_app`, `add_plat`, `delete`, `del_app`, `del_plat`, `edit`, and `edit_app`.
   2. Feature commands that do not modify ListingBook.
      1. Commands like `find` and `sort`.
3. Feature commands for special features.
   1. `undo`
   2. Autocomplete feature (no command)

Examples for the implementation of each category will be provided below.

###### _< Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) >_

### Basic features
For this category, we will be looking at the `add` command as an example.

The `add` command creates a new `Listing` in GoodMatch's Job Listing Management System.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
  :information_source: **Note:** Command format: <br/>
  <code>add t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION [p/PLATFORM]... [a/APPLICANT]...</code>
</div>

When a user use the `add` command:
1. When a user tries to run an add command, the system executes several steps to add a new listing to the application. 
2. The first step is to check if all the compulsory prefixes are present in the command and if the preamble is empty. 
3. If the check passes, the system creates a new listing with attributes based on the prefixes. 
4. The system then checks if the listing already exists in the model. 
5. If the listing exists, the system throws a command exception for duplicate listing. 
6. If the listing does not exist, the system adds the listing to the model and displays a success message to the user, indicating that the add command was executed successfully. 
7. However, if the check for compulsory prefixes fails or the preamble is non-empty, the system throws a parse error for invalid command format. 
8. By following these steps, users can successfully add new listings to the application while avoiding duplicate listings and incorrect command formats.

Please refer to the activity diagram below to see what happens when the user enters an `add` command.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png" />
  <em>Activity diagram for the <code>add</code> command</em>
</p>

#### Feature Implementation Details

1. The user will be specifying the details of the `Listing` in the add command.
2. There are a few details that a user can specify:
   1. `t/TITLE`: The job title of the listing (Compulsory).
   2. `d/DESCRIPTION`: The job description of the listing (Compulsory).
   3. `a/APPLICANT`: The applicants that applied using that job listing (Not compulsory, can input multiple).
   4. `p/PLATFORM`: The platforms that the job listing is posted on (Not compulsory, can input multiple).
3. The check for whether a `Listing` is in a `Model` or not is done using the `JobTitle` of the `Listing` only.
4. A preamble is the substring between the command word and the first prefix.
   1. For example, `add something t/title d/description`.
      1. The command word is `add`.
      2. The preamble is `something`.
      3. The first prefix is `t/`.

#### Design considerations

* The `add` command is implemented using the [`Logic`](#logic-component) and [`Model`](#model-component) components as shown in the [Design](#design) section above.
* The `add` and `delete` command share almost identical UML Sequence Diagrams.
* One advantage of using this design is that it is very scalable and new commands can be added easily.
  * Add a case into the switch case statement for the new command.
  * Add a `XYZCommandParser` class into `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser` to parse arguments (if any).
  * Add a `XYZCommand` class into `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands` to execute the parsed command from the step above.
  * Return the command result from the `XYZCommand` mentioned in the step above.
* However, one disadvantage for using this design choice is the file directory might be very difficult to understand for newcomers because function calls are very deeply nested.

### Find feature

The `find` command works by taking in keywords (can be a single keyword or multiple keywords) and identifies all the listings that contains at least one of the keywords in the title.
These listings are filtered out and displayed as a separate list. 
GoodMatch currently supports finding listings that contain the entire keyword inside, that is, listings that contain only part of the keyword will not be considered. For example, if the keyword is `pillow`, a listing with the title `pill` will not be identified.

Refer to the activity diagram below for a typical `find` command.
<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png" />
  <em>Activity diagram for the <code>find</code> command</em>
</p>


#### Feature Implementation Details

1. The user will be specifying the `keyword(s)` in the find command.
2. The `keyword(s)` cannot be empty.
3. The check for whether a `Listing` contains the keyword or not `model` or not is done using the `JobTitle` of the `Listing` only.

Refer to the sequence diagram below for a typical `find` command.
<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Sequence diagram for the <code>find</code> command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The lifeline for <code>FindCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

###### _< Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) >_
>>>>>>> master

### Sort feature

The `sort` feature works by taking in a field that the user wants to sort the ListingBook by, and then sorts according to that.
GoodMatch currently supports sorting by JobTitle, JobDescription, and Number of Applicants.
When sorting `String` like JobTitle and JobDescription, Listings in the ListingBook is sorted by lexicographical order, whereas for numerical values like number of applicants, Listings are sorted by the numerical value.
Sorting is all done in ascending order.

Refer to the activity diagram below for what happens when a user runs a `sort` command.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" 
   src="images/SortActivityDiagram.png" />
  <em>Activity diagram for the <code>sort</code> command</em>
</p>



Refer to the sequence diagram below for a typical `sort` command using `title` as the sorting field.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" 
   src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Sequence diagram for the <code>sort</code> command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Note: The lifeline for <code>SortCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

###### _< Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) >_


### Undo feature

The undo mechanism utilises the `prevListingBookStates` field in `ModelManager`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Model#undo()`‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâRestores the previous listing book state from its history.
* `Model#hasPreviousState()`‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâChecks if there are available listing book states in the history to undo into.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `prevListingBookStates` will be initialized with an empty `ArrayList`.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UndoState0.png" />
  <em>Initial state of the application.</em>
</p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th listing in the listing book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitListingBook()`, causing the modified state of the listing book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `prevListingBookStates`.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UndoState1.png" />
  <em>Saving <code>delete</code> modified listing book state.</em>
</p>

Step 3. The user executes `add t/Coder d/code‚Äã` to add a new listing. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitListingBook()`, causing another modified listing book state to be saved into the `prevListingBookStates`.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UndoState2.png" />
  <em>Saving <code>add</code> modified listing book state.</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitListingBook()`, so the listing book state will not be saved into the `prevListingBookStates`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the listing was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which restores the previous listing book state by setting as the `listingBook` and deleting it from `prevListingBookStates`.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" 
   src="images/UndoState3.png" />
  <em>Restoring the previous listing book state.</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the <code>prevListingBookStates</code> is empty, then there are no previous ListingBook states to restore. The <code>undo</code> command uses <code>Model#hasPreviousState()</code> to check if undo is possible. If not, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following activity diagram shows how the `undo` operation works:

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UndoActivityDiagram.png" />
  <em>Activity diagram for the <code>undo</code> command.</em>
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Sequence Diagram for the <code>undo</code> command.</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>UndoCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `view`. Commands that do not modify the listing book, such as `view`, will usually not call `Model#commitListingBook()` or `Model#undo()`. Thus, the `prevListingBookStates` remains unchanged.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UndoState4.png" />
  <em>Commands that do not modify the listing book.</em>
</p>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

### Autocomplete feature

The autocomplete feature allows a user to cycle through suggested commands based on the partial command that is typed in the command box.

To use it, a user has to type a partial command, then press TAB to cycle through a list of suggested commands that was generated based on the partial command.
For example, when a user types `a` into the command box, `add`, `add_app`, and `add_plat` will be suggested and the user is able to cycle through them by pressing TAB.

When a user types a partial command:
1. Check if the user's input is already in the list of suggestions and is not equal to `add`.
2. If the check passes, no new suggestions are generated.
3. Else, a new list of suggestions is generated like so
   1. Command suggestions are added from a list of possible commands.
   2. Command usages are added based on the command suggestions from step (i).
   3. The entire list is sorted based on the length of suggestion and returned.
4. If there is at least 1 suggestion, the prompt "TAB to cycle through suggestions" will be made visible.

When a user presses TAB:
1. GoodMatch gets the text currently in the commandTextField and searches for it in a list of suggestions. 
2. If the text is not found in the list of suggestions, the first suggestion is selected. 
3. If the text is found in the list of suggestions, the next suggestion in the list is selected. 
4. The selected suggestion is then set as the text in the commandTextField.
5. The focus is set back to the commandTextField.
6. The text cursor is positioned at the end of the suggestion.

Please refer to the activity diagram below to see what happens when a user uses the autocomplete feature.

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png" />
  <em>Activity diagram for the autocomplete feature.</em>
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows how the autocomplete operation works:

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png" />
  <em>Sequence diagram for the autocomplete feature.</em>
</p>


#### Feature Implementation details

1. commandTextField is the text input field on the GUI for users to type their inputs in.
2. Autocomplete is only done for commands at the moment and not for commonly used words.

#### Design considerations

1. This is an early version of the feature.
2. Only commands are inside the word list and since the word list is small, we can afford to find for matches directly.
3. There are plans on expanding this feature and improving on it as stated below.
   1. Apply autocomplete to commonly used words in the job search industry. 
      1. Searching for words cannot be done directly, due to slow performances issues.
      2. Searching will be implemented using Tries for faster performance.
      3. Commonly used words include "manager", "senior", "engineer"
   2. Show suggested words and allow users to click to select desired word.
      1. Better user experience for instances where user wants a long suggestion.
      2. User is able to see at a glance whether the correct suggestion is generated rather than having to cycle through everything.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Sort none
1. Sort none is currently not producing the proper results at times. To counter this, we propose to introduce a new field to sort by: time_added. This way, we can 'turn off' the sorting mode and order listings by chronological order instead to avoid confusion when adding new listings.

### Changing IDs of applicants
2. To counter the issue of changing IDs of applicants upon every startup, we propose to store the unique IDs together with the Applicant object when it is first created to avoid the confusion caused by changing IDs. The local state should store applicants with their Name and ID instead of just the`Name`.
