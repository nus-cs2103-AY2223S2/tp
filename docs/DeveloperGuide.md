## **Introduction**

### Intended Audience
As future contributors to CoDoc, we hope this Developer Guide is sufficient in documenting and illustrating the underlying architecture of CoDoc. This guide provides
insights on how our product is designed, implemented and tested as well as the design considerations that were involved
in deciding the implementation of various features offered by CoDoc.

You are recommended to read the [Navigating the Developer Guide](#navigating-the-developer-guide) and [Glossary](#glossary)
sections, which will provide the necessary information to allow you to familiarise yourself with the structure of this
Developer Guide and help you navigate it with ease.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

### Target Audience
CoDoc is **designed for NUS students** by providing a centralised platform for them to keep track
of their friends' contact information, modules and skills. CoDoc is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI).

For students who are fast typers, CoDoc is an excellent platform for you to find and identify your friends with certain capabilities and experience,
so you can spend less time searching through chats, and spend more time making
meaningful connections and engaging in productive work.

## **Design Architecture**
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.
</div>

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />


The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of each component and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Components of the architecture**

* **`Main`**: has two classes called `Main` and `MainApp` which are responsible for,
  * At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
  * At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.
* [**`Commons`**](#commons-component): represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the core architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the core components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four core components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class, as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** Implementing the core component's API through an interface prevents outside component from being coupled to it.
</div>

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

### Commons Component

A collection of classes used by multiple other components located in the [`codoc.commons`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/codoc/commons) package.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/codoc/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `InfoTab`, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `CourseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/codoc/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

**The `UI` component:**

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/codoc/logic/Logic.java)
Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

**How the `Logic` component works:**
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CodocParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.
<br>
The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

**How the parsing works:**
* when called upon to parse a user command, the `CodocParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CodocParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* all `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model Component
The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/codoc/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


**The `Model` component:**

* stores CoDoc data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Skill` list in the `Codoc`, which `Person` references. This allows `Codoc` to only require one `Skill` object per unique skill, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Skill` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

### Storage Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/codoc/storage/Storage.java)
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**The `Storage` component:** 
* can save both CoDoc data and user preference in `json` format, and read them back to corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `CodocStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`) the notable being:
  * `model.ReadOnlyUserPrefs`: for gui settings and data file path
  * `model.ReadOnlyReadOnlyCodoc`: an unmodifiable list of all person added
  * `model.person.Person`: information of a person
  * `model.module.Module`: a module object 
  * `model.skill.Skill` : a skill object

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The location in which both files are saved are specified in `commons.core.config`.
</div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
<br>

### **UI Implementation**

This section describes implementation of features within `ui` package.

On program initialization, `UiManager` creates `MainWindow` as a primary stage which is mainly divided into three
parts, the left [Course List Panel](#course-list-panel) which shows all available courses, the middle [Main Section](#main-section) which handles user input and executes command, the right side
[Info Panel](#info-panel) which shows more details about a specific person.

![ui-main-sections](images/ui-diagrams/ui-main-sections.png)

Visual design of this section are implemented using the CSS file under resources. Details of such implementation are
explained under [Theme](#theme) section.

<br>

Refer to [UI Component](#ui-component) for more information about this package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Course List Panel**
The course list panel shows all the available courses and their corresponding numbers.

![ui-main-sections](images/ui-diagrams/ui-course-list-panel.png)

The content with the 13 courses are stored in `CourseList` class as an `ArrayList` of `String`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Main section**

Main section consists of the following components:

* [CommandBox](#commandbox)
* [ResultDisplay](#resultdisplay)
* [PersonListPanel](#personlistpanel)
* [StatusBarFooter](#statusbarfooter)

![ui-main-section-sections](images/ui-diagrams/ui-main-section-sections.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **CommandBox**

**Main input for the UI.**

`CommandBox`'s constructor takes in a `CommandExecutor` that is passed by the `MainWindow`. This creates a single, 
bidirectional association between the two, removing the need for the `CommandBox` to interact with the `Model` directly.

Users are able to write their commands into its text field and execute it by pressing `Enter` key.

##### Design considerations

Commands may execute successfully or fail throwing exceptions. To increase usability of the `CommandBox`, following are
implemented:
* On succesful execution: text field is reset to be empty, ready to take in more commands.
* On failed execution: command in text field is kept but shown in different color to indicate error, so that users can 
modify the command without having to rewrite the whole command.

<br>

#### **ResultDisplay**

**Main output for the UI.**

Even though the program supports GUI, main interaction between the user and the program happens through the CLI. This
leads to a need for showing results of command as Strings which the users can refer to, gaining more understanding about
execution of commands.

##### Design considerations

Since the execution of command is handled by the `Logic` component, all it needs to have is an uneditable text field
that is updated by the `MainWindow` after execution. Respective commands executed are responsible for the content of
this update, adhering to the segregation of concerns principle.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **PersonListPanel**

Part of the main section that displays a list of person registered to the CoDoc database.

The list is created as a ListView. More information about ListView
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/ListView.html).

##### Design considerations

Since the list is updated constantly as program executes, ListView was chosen as the way to display the list since it
is able to observe changes in its content (as long as it is an 
[ObservableList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/ObservableList.html)) and reflect the
change during execution without having the user to update what is shown on the program separately.

To allow cells within the ListView to show relevant information about a person, `PersonListPanel` also has a custom
class `PersonListViewCell` that acts as a factory to create the cells through `PersonCard` class. Developers interested
in changing how the cells within the ListView look should look into `PersonCard` and its `.fxml` file for modification.

#### **StatusBarFooter**

Small section at the bottom of the program to show information about the status of the program.

Currently, it shows the path for CoDoc's database. Developers who are looking to show any other status to the user
(such as internet connection availability, if required in future implementation) may use this to display such
information.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Info Panel**

Info Panel is controlled by classes under [`codoc.ui.infopanel`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/codoc/ui/infopanel) package. It is initialized by the primary component `InfoTab`
which shows more information about a person on the top half, and loads up `DetailedInfo` on the bottom part.

Info Panel consists of the following components:

* [InfoTab](#infotab)
* [DetailedInfo](#detailedinfo)
  * [DetailedContact](#detailedcontact)
  * [DetailedModule](#detailedmodule)
  * [DetailedSkill](#detailedskill)

| InfoTab with DetailedContact                                           | InfoTab with DetailedModule                                          | InfoTab with DetailedSkill                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![ui-info-panel-contact](images/ui-diagrams/ui-info-panel-contact.png) | ![ui-info-panel-module](images/ui-diagrams/ui-info-panel-module.png) | ![ui-info-panel-skill](images/ui-diagrams/ui-info-panel-skill.png) |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **InfoTab**

Similar to how `MainWindow` is the main controller for the primary stage, `InfoTab` is the class that acts as the 
**main controller** for the right section, Info Panel.

![info-tab-sequence-diagram](images/InfoTabSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design considerations

The Info Panel is implemented to show details of a person as [PersonListPanel](#personlistpanel) is unable to show all
information about a person given limited space within each cell. This "staged" person is called internally code-wise as
`protagonist` and shall be referred to as that.

However, even by having a separate panel dedicated for showing such information, the set of modules or skills a person
has may grow so large to show all of them in one section. Furthermore, user do not need to see all of them at once as
for the moment there are no direct links between contacts, modules and skills information of a person.

This led to the design which top part of `InfoTab` shows basic information about the `protagonist` (name, year, course
of study) and bottom part shows whatever [DetailedInfo](#detailedinfo) user wish to display. Since the name or course of
study could become very long, the containing `VBox` has been allowed to grow and the information containing `label` are
set to wrap its text.

Note that there are no listeners that observes the changes made to the staged `progatonist`. This is to prevent
over-coupling of components which makes maintenance of code much harder. Instead, `MainWindow`'s `executeCommand`
creates a new `InfoTab` at the end of every execution by referring to the `protagonist` at given state.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


#### **DetailedInfo**

This is the parent class of the three different types of `DetailedInfo`, which are `DetailedContact`, `DetailedModule` and
`DetailedSkill`.

##### Design considerations

`InfoTab` may create either of the children classes, depending on what the user has specified using the
[ViewCommand](#view-command). This parent class utilizes Java's polymorphism so that `InfoTab` can just display
generated `DetailedInfo` that gets loaded into the bottom `detailedInfoPlaceholder` StackPane within the `InfoTab`.

#### **DetailedContact**

Controller class for Info Panel which holds detailed contact information about a person. Shows contact information such
as GitHub user ID, email address and LinkedIn profile URL.

#### **DetailedModule**

Controller class for Info Panel which holds detailed module information about a person. Shows a list of modules taken
by a person that is created as a ListView, similar to the [PersonListPanel](#personlistpanel).

#### **DetailedSkill**

Controller class for Info Panel which holds detailed skill information about a person. Shows a list of skills possessed
by a person that is created as a ListView.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Theme**

Most of the Java FXML components follow the style specified by the CSS file `CodocTheme.css`. Refer to this file under
the `view` package within the `resources` folder when visual design changes are to be made.

CSS file also contains colors shown in the program in RGB color codes, developers may refer to
[this page](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html) to decipher them.

Commonly used colors are:
1. **#bfbfbf**: Dark gray color for borders.
2. **#808080**: Even darker gray for most of the texts shown on the program.
3. **#ffffff**: White color used for most of the backgrounds existing.

Fonts used in this program but not part of system fonts are stored in the `resources` folder as well, under the `font`
package. These are loaded by the `MainApp` class upon initialization of the program. Mainly used fonts are:
1. **Roboto Mono Regular**: contents requiring mono-spacing for better alignment (such as list of skills/modules).
2. **Roboto Bold and Regular**: most of the texts displayed on the program.
3. **Segeo UI**: for system-related texts (such as [CommandBox](#commandbox), [ResultDisplay](#resultdisplay) or
[StatusBarFooter](#statusbarfooter)).

### **Logic Implementation**

This section describes implementation of features within `logic` package. Refer to [Logic component](#logic-component)
for more information about this package.

#### **Add Command**

Adding a person is implemented such that the user must specify the person's `name`, `year`, `course` and `email`. 
An error will be shown if the user failed to specify these compulsory parameters.
The optional parameters are `GitHub`, `LinkedIn`, `Skills` and `Modules`. These will be instantiated as `null` if the user did not specify.

`Add` has the prefixes as follows:
* `n/` for name
* `e/` for email
* `y/` for year
* `c/` for course
* `g/` for GitHub
* `l/` for LinkedIn
* `m/` for updating the current module list
* `s/` for updating the current skill list

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Implementation Flow

Given below is a sequence diagram to illustrate how the person list is updated after the user attempts to add a new
person.

![Add Command Sequence Diagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an activity diagram to illustrate the behaviour of adding Person within `Logic`.

![Add Activity Diagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

Refer to [here](#creating-attributes-for-the-person) for activity diagram on creating attributes for the person.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Design Considerations

To add more skills and modules, the user will have to specify the prefix. E.g. to add python and java as a skill, the user will need to input `s/python` and `s/java` instead of `s/python java`.
This is because some skills such as `Microsoft Office` or `React Native` have more than 1 word and will create a conflict with `s/React Native` and `s/python java`. Hence, separating 2 skills with spaces cannot work.

Another consideration is the implementation of the `course` parameter. We wanted to prevent users from entering different interpretations of the same course.
E.g. `Computer Science` could be represented by `comp sci` or `cs` etc. Hence, to standardize our `Storage` and `Ui` for every person, we implemented a `Courselist` that users can select the respective `course` using the `index`.
More details about the `Course` class can be found [here](#course-and-courselist-class)

Lastly, if the application has an empty contact list, the [Info Panel](#info-panel) will display the newly added person once the execution of the `add command` is completed. 
However, when the person list is not empty, the [Info Panel](#info-panel) will not display the newly added person as we did not to change the state of other panels within the application with the execution of this `add command`.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Edit Command**

Editing a person's attributes is implemented such that the user can only edit the person in the right view panel.
For `name`, `year`, `course`, `email`, `GitHub`, `LinkedIn`, the command will replace the old data with the new input.

For `Skills` and `Modules`, the command is capable of adding, deleting and updating existing data.

`Edit` has the prefixes as follows:
* `n/` for name
* `e/` for email
* `y/` for year
* `c/` for course
* `g/` for GitHub
* `l/` for LinkedIn
* `m/` for updating the current module list
* `m+/` for adding a new module
* `m-/` for deleting an existing module
* `s/` for updating the current skill list
* `s+/` for adding a new skill
* `s-/` for deleting an existing skill

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Implementation Flow

Given below is a sequence diagram to illustrate how the person list is updated after the user attempts to edit the
person.

![Edit Command Sequence Diagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an activity diagram to illustrate the behaviour when user calls the `Edit` command.

![EditCommandActivity](images/EditCommandRunActivity.png)

The EditCommandParser parses the passed command and create a EditPersonDescriptor for the EditCommand to execute
on. It checks if prefix are present in the command to update the EditPersonDescriptor.

![EditParserCheck](images/EditParserActivity.png)

*Refer to the EditCommandParser code for more information on the relationship between each prefix and attributes.

One notable thing about EditPersonDescriptor are its sets to handle : skillsAdded, skillsRemoved and skillsFinal. Similar sets
were implemented for modules as well. Parser handles all entries and get them assigned to EditPersonDescriptor.

Before EditCommand executes, it will look into these sets to check if command is valid to run, illustrated by the
activity diagram [here](#editcommand-checking-for-valid-set-operations)


If skillsRemoved or modulesRemoved are not empty, it will look through existing skills and modules of protagonist to
ensure all of them are present (using containsAll method for Set). If any one of them does not exist in protagonist,
it will throw CommandException with respective error messages. This can be improved by using contains method instead
for every element then throwing the exception with specific skill/module that caused the exception.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

```java
if (editPersonDescriptor.getSkillsRemoved().isPresent()) {
    Set<Skill> original = personToEdit.getSkills();
    Set<Skill> edited = editPersonDescriptor.getSkillsRemoved().get();
    if (!original.containsAll(edited)) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_SKILL_DOES_NOT_EXIST);
    }
}

if (editPersonDescriptor.getModulesRemoved().isPresent()) {
    Set<Module> original = personToEdit.getModules();
    Set<Module> edited = editPersonDescriptor.getModulesRemoved().get();
    if (!original.containsAll(edited)) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_MOD_DOES_NOT_EXIST);
    }
}
```

As EditCommand executes, it creates a new EditedPerson. Other attributes are simply updated, but modules and skills are
sets to be updated following a sequence of activity below:

![EditCommandUpdateSkills](images/EditSkillsActivity.png)

Similar process exist for set of modules.
   1. It will first look into original skills and modules.
   2. Entries to be removed are first removed, then entries to be added are added.
   3. If any final set of an attribute exists, the updates above are ignored and new set will be created with entries
   within the final set. If the final set is an empty one, it will clear existing set

```java
Set<Skill> removedSkills = editPersonDescriptor.getSkillsRemoved()
        .orElse(new HashSet<>());
Set<Skill> addedSkills = editPersonDescriptor.getSkillsAdded()
        .orElse(new HashSet<>());
Set<Skill> updatedSkills = new HashSet<>(personToEdit.getSkills());
updatedSkills.removeAll(removedSkills); // Remove takes priority
updatedSkills.addAll(addedSkills);
Set<Skill> finalSkills = editPersonDescriptor.getSkillsFinal().orElse(updatedSkills);
Set<Module> removedModules = editPersonDescriptor.getModulesRemoved()
        .orElse(new HashSet<>());
Set<Module> addedModules = editPersonDescriptor.getModulesAdded()
        .orElse(new HashSet<>());
Set<Module> updatedModules = new HashSet<>(personToEdit.getModules());
updatedModules.removeAll(removedModules); // Remove takes priority
updatedModules.addAll(addedModules);
Set<Module> finalModules = editPersonDescriptor.getModulesFinal()
        .orElse(updatedModules);
```

##### Design Considerations

We initially created 2 additional prefixes to updating the `Skills` and `Modules` using old and new prefixes.
However, we realised the behaviour is similar to simply deleting and adding new modules and skills.
Hence, we removed the implementation of the old and new prefixes.

`s/` is the strongest, entailing `s+/` and `s-/` will be ignored because users can include them within `s/` anyway.
All `s-/` will happen before all `s+/`, so that editing specific modules can happen correctly (both `s-/abc s+/abc` and
`s+/abc s-/abc` will keep skill `abc`). If the order of execution was reversed, edit would not work correctly.

The priority had to be in place so that it is able to handle cases where all prefixes are present during execution, 
since `ArgumentMultimap` only maps the prefixes to a list but is unable to hold any information about specific ordering
of prefixes

This logic is only important when user is adding/removing a same skill (or module), which act as a safety net for users
using edit command in a poor way.

#### **Find Command**

Finding i.e. filtering a person by their attributes is implemented such that the user can find people by their `name`, `year`, `course`, `modules` and/or `skills`, such that he/she is able to reach out to them for collaboration more quickly.

- `FilteredList` contains people that must satisfy **all** attribute predicates corresponding to the prefixes specified by user.
- **Predicates will continue to stack** until a successful execution of `add`, `edit` or `list` which will clear all predicates that the user input thereby showing the full list.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** Logical AND not logical OR.
</div>
- **Can check for multiple predicates within each prefix** i.e. `find s/python java` finds people that have both `python` and `java` skills.
- Checks if the attributes of the person **contain** the keywords specified by the user.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** Uses contain, not containWord.
</div>

- Case-insensitive.
- If the user types duplicate prefixes in the query i.e. `find s/java python s/javascript s/c sql`, only the last occurrence of the prefix will be taken i.e. `find s/c sql` will be taken.

`find` has the prefixes corresponding to attributes as follows:
* `n/` for `Name`
* `y/` for `Year`
* `c/` for `Course`
* `m/` for `Module`
* `s/` for `Skill`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation Flow**

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a `find` command:

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

`ModelManager`, which implements the `Model` interface, stores an attribute `filteredPersons`, which is a `FilteredList` of `Person`s that is shown in the `MainWindow` class as a `PersonListPanel`. When a `find` command is called by the user, `ModelManager` updates its `filteredPersons` to only contain `Person`s that satisfy all the `predicate`s corresponding to the attibrutes specified by the user. The `PersonListPanel` in the `MainWindow` UI is then updated accordingly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the activity diagram to illustrate what happens when the user calls the `find` command:

![Find Activity Diagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

Refer to [here](#findcommand-combining-predicates) for activity diagram on combining predicates.

<br>

##### Design Considerations

We made our `find` command able to **find by multiple attributes** i.e. `find n/david y/2` instead of `findn david` and `findy 2`. This way, our find command becomes powerful whereby the user can find by not just one attribute, but rather a combination of attributes. The user just needs to specify the prefixes corresponding to the attributes they want to find by. No need to remember many variants of the find command like `findy`, `findc`, `findm` and `finds`.

Our find command can **take in multiple keywords for each attribute prefix** i.e. `find m/cs2109s cs2103t` finds people that are taking have taken both CS2109S and CS2103T. We made it this way instead of `find m/cs2109s m/cs2103t` to increase the speed of the search i.e. user requires less key presses.

We also chose to make our find command case-insensitive to increase the speed of the search i.e. user does not need to press the Caps Lock key.

**Aspect 1: `find` by logical AND vs `find` by logical OR:**

- Alternative 1 (current choice): `find` by logical AND
  - Pros: User can find people that have multiple attributes (includes attributes within a single prefix), i.e. `find m/cs2109s cs2103t s/python` finds people that are proficient in python and are taking/have taken both CS2109S and CS2103T.
  - Cons: More restrictive on the filtered people, people must have **all** the attributes specified by the user to be in the `FilteredList`.
- Alternative 2: `find` by logical OR
  - Pros: Less restrictive - as long as the person have at least 1 attribute specified by the user, it will be in the `FilteredList` i.e. `find y/2 c/com` finds people that are either year 2, taking courses that contains 'com', or both.
  - Cons:
    User cannot find people that have multiple attributes.
- Decision: We chose Alternative 1 as it provides an option that Alternative 2 does not, whereas if the user want to find people that have either of the attributes, they can still do so with Alternative 1, but they would have to call multiple `find` commands i.e. if the user wants to find people that are either y/2 or proficient in python, he/she has to call `find y/2`, followed by `find s/python`, or vice versa. Most websites use find by logical AND such as GitHub, YouTube and Shopee.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Aspect 2: `find` by contains vs containsWord:**

- Alternative 1 (current choice): `find` by contains
  - Pros: User can find people that have attributes containing the keywords specified by the user, i.e. `find c/com` finds people that enrolled in courses containing 'com', `find n/d` finds people that have 'd' in their name, makes it less restrictive when searching.
  - Cons: Harder for user to find people that match the exact keyword i.e. `find n/sam` will also match people named Samantha, Sammy, Samuel, etc., will have more search results making it harder for the user if he/she just wants to find people named Sam.
- 
- Alternative 2: `find` by containsWord (not a built-in method but can be created)
  - Pros: Resolves the cons in Alternative 1.
  - Cons:
    Harder for people to show up in the `FilteredList`, might lead to the user missing out on information that might be useful, i.e. find m/cs1101 will only find people that are taking/have taken CS1101 but it will not show people taking/have taken other variants of CS1101 such as CS1101S and CS1101R. In such cases, the user might want to find these people but are unaware that these variants even exist, and even if he/she know, he/she would have to query multiple commands like `find m/CS1101S` and `find m/CS1101R`, which makes it more time-consuming.
- Decision: We chose Alternative 1 as it is more conventional; our normal Ctrl-F or Cmd-F searches by contains instead of containsWord. This option enables the user to search faster, have more search results and can inform users about information that could be useful to them.

**Aspect 3: single use vs consecutive uses of `find`:**

- Alternative 1 (current choice): `find` can be used consecutively with `list` to clear filters
  - Pros: User can narrow down their search results by calling the `find` command consecutively, i.e. `find y/1` followed by `find s/python` finds people that are both year 1 and have python skills. This is useful especially if the user wants to apply additional filters to the search results. 
  - Cons: Harder for user to execute separate `find` commands, i.e. if a user wants to find people that are y/1 or have python skills he/she would have to call `find y/1` followed by `list`, and then `find s/python`, needing to call `list` every time to clear applied filters. User might forget to do so, leading to search results being smaller than expected.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Alternative 2: `find` can only be used maximum once effectively
  - Pros: Clears applied filters automatically before finding every time `find` is called. No need for user to call `list` between each `find` command.
  - Cons:
    User must retype `find` command with the applied filters if he/she wants to find by an additional filter, i.e. if user entered `find y/1` and realised that he/she wants to find people that are year 1 and have python skills, he/she would have to call `find y/1 s/python` instead of just `find s/python` as proposed in Alternative 1. The more the applied filters, the more time-consuming it is for the user to retype them when adding a filter.
- Decision: We chose Alternative 1 as it is commonly used. Websites like Shopee and GitHub remember existing filters and allow users to add more filters if they want to. They also have a reset/clear filters feature/button to clear filters. To inform users of what filters they have applied, we display them in the `ResultDisplay` UI, with the latest filter at the top denoted after `>`.

#### **View Command**

Command that handles interaction with the Info Panel. It is designed to handle two types of parameters:
- Integer that represents the index of contact to load to Info Panel.
- Character that represents the specific tab of the Info Panel to view (`c`/`m`/`s`).

**Implementation Flow**

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a `view` command with an Index:

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

If command is executed with a tab character instead, `setCurrentTab` will be called instead of `setProtagonist`. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the activity diagram to illustrate what happens when the user calls the `View` command:

![View Activity Diagram](images/ViewCommandActivity.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Design Considerations

View Command is a primary way for users to interact with the Info Panel. Since both switching between person and tabs
serve a similar purpose to update the Info Panel, the two commands `ViewIndex` and `ViewTab` has been merged under one
`View` command.

This means that it must be able to parse user inputs correctly to handle the two different parameters mentioned above.
To do so, `isNumeric` method has been implemented which tries to parse given parameter as an Index.
- If successful, return True (parameter is a valid integer)
- If an exception is caught, there are two possible cases:
  - Parameter is not an integer (Character which represents the tab to view)
  - Number is too big to be parsed to an integer.

To handle these cases separately and return a correct error message, this method will try to parse the parameter into
a `BigInteger` again to confirm that the given parameter is definitely not a numeric.

Once the command has been parsed and a ViewCommand has been instantiated, it just updates `Model`'s tab or protagonists
appropriately. This is to adhere to Separation of Concerns principle, where only the UI component is responsible of how
the Info Panel gets updated to the users. Refer to [Info Panel](#info-panel) for more information.

### **Model Implementation**

This section describes implementation of features within `model` package. Refer to [Model component](#model-component) for more
information about this package.

#### **Person Class**
Each `Person` in CoDoc is implemented in the following way:

![Person Class Diagram](images/PersonClassDiagram.png)

All `Person` must have a `Name`, `Email`, `Course` and `Year`.

`Person` can have a `Github` and `Linkedin` URL added to their profile, and as many `Skills` and `Modules` as desired.

##### Handling Duplicates
For duplicate persons, instead of checking whether they had the same `Name`, we decided to check if they had the same `Email`, since students can have the same name but their emails are always different.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** CoDoc is design in such a way where no two person can have the same email.
</div>

##### Profile Picture Attribute
`ProfilePicture` of a `Person` is randomly picked from a pool of 50 avatar icons whenever the `Person` is added. Not only does this improve the aesthetics of CoDoc, but it can also help users identify contacts by their `ProfilePicture`. Allowing users to add their own preferred profile picture has been considered but as of right now, this just serves as a default placeholder picture for each `Person`. `ProfilePicture` is part of the `Person` model and is saved like the other attributes.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Skills Attribute
We included the `Skills` attribute to remind the user to add in the person's skills (java, python, sql, etc.), which can be useful in cases where the user wants to scout for project members with specific skills.

##### Design Consideration

**How to implement the `GitHub` and `Linkedin` attributes:**

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Make them optional i.e. each person does not need to have a GitHub username or LinkedIn profile URL
  - Pros: Faster to add a new person as the user can leave out these attributes when typing. More flexible as the user does not need to know the person's attribute to be able to add him/her.
  - Cons: Lack of details, user may want to check out the person's GitHub profile/projects or connect with them through LinkedIn instead of email.
- Alternative 2: Make them compulsory
  - Pros: Can remind users to ask the person that they are adding for their socials such that they can look them up if they want to.
  - Cons:
    Slower and more inconvenient, need to add these attributes when adding a person.
- Decision: We chose Alternative 1 as speed is important. The LinkedIn profile URL can be very lengthy as well. Since users can already connect with the added persons through their email, which is a compulsory attribute, we decided to make these socials optional.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Module Class**
Each module in CoDoc have a string representing its module.
##### Regex and validation
All module string should satisfy the following regex pattern,

`^AY[0-9]{4}S[12] [A-Z]+[0-9]+[A-Z]*`

For example, a valid Module string is "AY2223S1 CS1101S"

Additionally, a final validation is required to ensure that the 4 digit after
the "AY" is valid.

The following are **valid** 4 digit sequence (last 2 digits are increments of first 2 digits)
- 2223
- 9900
- 0102

The following are **invalid** (the last 2 digit number is not an increment of the first)
- 2224
- 1111
- 2019

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Course and CourseList Class**
Each `Course` in CoDoc is implemented in the following way:

![Course Class Diagram](images/CourseClassDiagram.png)

All `Course` hava a `String` representing the name of the course.

##### Design Considerations
The `Course` constructor accepts a `String` input that represents the index of the course name
residing in `COURSE_LIST` found in the `CourseList.java`. This `COURSE_LIST` is displayed in the left panel
of the GUI, along with the corresponding index of the course name.

Instead of parsing the name of the course directly into
the `Course` constructor, we wanted to standardize the names of courses without allowing users to
input their own course names. This prevents 1 course from having multiple `String` representations
in our `Storage` as well as the courses displayed in the application.

### **Potential Enhancement**

#### \[Proposed\] Undo and Redo Feature

##### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCodoc`. It extends `Codoc` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `codocStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCodoc#commit()` — Saves the current CoDoc state in its history.
* `VersionedCodoc#undo()` — Restores the previous CoDoc state from its history.
* `VersionedCodoc#redo()` — Restores a previously undone CoDoc state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCodoc()`, `Model#undoCodoc()` and `Model#redoCodoc()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCodoc` will be initialized with the initial CoDoc state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CoDoc state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in CoDoc. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCodoc()`, causing the modified state of CoDoc after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `codocStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CoDoc state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCodoc()`, causing another modified CoDoc state to be saved into the `codocStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCodoc()`, so CoDoc state will not be saved into the `codocStateList`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCodoc()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CoDoc state, and restores CoDoc to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Codoc state, then there are no previous Codoc states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCodoc()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoCodoc()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores CoDoc to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `codocStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CoDoc state, then there are no undone Codoc states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCodoc()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify CoDoc, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCodoc()`, `Model#undoCodoc()` or `Model#redoCodoc()`. Thus, the `codocStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCodoc()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `codocStateList`, all CoDoc states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CoDoc.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. CoDoc does not check for duplicate `GitHub` usernames or `LinkedIn` profile URLs, so the user can add 2 or more contacts with the same `GitHub` usernames and/or `LinkedIn` profile URLs. We plan to make it such that CoDoc checks for this, on top of email, so each person can be uniquely identified by their `GitHub` username and `LinkedIn` profile URL as well. 
2. CoDoc's usage messages might display attributes in orders that are not consistent, e.g. `add` command uses "...n/NAME e/EMAIL c/COURSE y/YEAR [g/GITHUB] [l/LINKEDIN] [s/SKILL] [m/MOD]..." but `edit` command uses "...[n/NAME] [g/GITHUB] [e/EMAIL] [c/COURSE] [y/YEAR] [l/LINKEDIN]
   [s+/SKILL] [s-/SKILL] [m+/MOD] [m-/MOD]...". We plan to standardize these inconsistencies by making all usage messages to follow this order: _Name_, _Email_, _Year_, _Course_, _GitHub_, _LinkedIn_, _Modules_, _Skills_. This should ensure consistency between commands and with the User Guide.
3. There can be cases where a person's name contains a `.` or a `/`, especially some Western or Malay names. However, as these are extreme features, we left them out as they do not hinder the original usage of the function. Hence, it is a nice-to-have feature that we will fix in the future by altering the regex for `Name`. Users can, in the meantime, work around this by entering an alternative name instead.
4. When using the copy buttons to copy `GitHub` username or `LinkedIn` profile URL, it would be good to implement a message that appears in the result display, informing the user that an empty `String` was copied or that nothing was copied. This will be added in the future as it is not a bug and does not affect usage of the copy button.
5. `find c/-1` will generate an empty list with no contacts. However, it will good to include a validity check as `-1` is an invalid input for `course` and should be showing an error message instead. We will implement this validity check in the future as it does not return a wrong list of filtered people.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

Here is a product scope for CoDoc 🔍️

**Target user profile** 🧑:

There is no platform for students of NUS to easily identify people of similar interest and skills to aid them in
their study and career. The product aims to help students organize and easily identify potential study/project/career
partners that they have encountered over the course of their study and provide necessary contact information for
networking opportunities.

Following are characteristics of people who can benefit from our product:

* has difficulties tracking peers met over the course of study
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* wants to find project partners of similar background
* prefers a full desktop application over other data management tools
* able to type fast
* comfortable with CLI (command-line interface)

**Value proposition** 🔥:

CoDoc is not only able to help users manage large contact database fast through CLI, it is also able to display
relevant contact information through a comprehensive UI. Furthermore, users can utilize the powerful filtering system
to effectively sort/filter contacts to easily identify people of interest, such as study or project partners.
