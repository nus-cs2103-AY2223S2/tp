### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram1.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Data Summary feature

#### Implementation

It extends `AddressBook`. Data summary includes contact count, number of tags,...

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the data summary mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user populate the address book with commands such as add, edit, delete.

Step 3. The user click on the summary tab.

Step 4. The user now sees a summary of his/her data.

Step 5. The user then decides to close the tab, he/she clicks on the close button.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/SummaryActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Why this implementation:
Keeping a summary in a new tab makes the UI much neater, rather than displaying a summary in the main page.
This also allows user to access their summary easily as the summary tab will be fixed at the top of the page.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How data summary display executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display in a separate tab.
    * Pros: Convenience for the user.
    * Cons: Slight revamp of UI is needed.

* **Alternative 2:** Display in the main page.

    * Pros: Ease to implement.
    * Cons: Information will be cramped together.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Filter by tag feature

#### Implementation
The proposed feature will allow users to filter persons by the tags they possess.
It is implemented similar to the `FindCommand`, extending `CommandParser` with a new command to parse.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Filter` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User inputs command `filter`, followed by a list of arguments representing the tag names
example `carInsurance`

Step 2. The command "filter" will be parsed, creating a Filter command which is executable.

Step 3. On execution of the filter command, the filter checks and returns a list of all persons which match exactly the tags specified

Step 4. For example, `filter car insurance` returns a list of persons which have both `car` and `insurance` as tags, any person with only one of the two tags will not be included

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:
![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/filterSeqDiag.png)

#### Design considerations:

1. Users would like to be able to filter which category of leads they would like to view
2. Users would like to be able to specify multiple tags to narrow down their search on relevant contacts
3. Users would also be able to edit their clients/persons category

**Aspect: How filter decides on output:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only output persons which contain all tags.
    * Pros: Allow user to narrow down search quicker.
    * Cons: Lesser contacts are displayed to user.

* **Alternative 2:** Output persons which have at least 1 of the specified tags.

    * Pros: Broad search of all tags.
    * Cons: Too much information, might be harder to narrow down search.

#### Why this implementation
We would like users to be able to narrow down search by filtering more and more categories,
hence we allow multiple arguments input and require that all arguments are satisfied. Depending on customer feedback,
we may change to the other alternative of a broad search, where we output all contacts that contain any of the specified tags.



### Sort feature

#### Implementation
The proposed feature will allow users to sort their contacts in multiple ways according to fields:
1. Name `name`
2. Potential Sale Value `size`
3. Past Transaction Count `trans`
4. Priority `priority`

The feature allows users to sort contacts according to one of the above fields at a time, in 2 directions:
1. Ascending `asc`
2. Descending `desc`

Note that the sort feature updates the original contact list to be sorted accordingly.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Sort` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User inputs command `sort FIELD DIRECTION` example `sort size asc`

Step 2. The respective sort command will be parsed, taking into account the FIELD and DIRECTION to sort by
* The sort command parser takes in the arguments and is case-insensitive
* meaning `SOrt PRIORITY DeSc` for example is equivalent to `sort priority desc`

Step 3. After which the parser creates the respective sort command which is executable.

Step 4. On execution of the sort command, the database of contacts is sorted accordingly using the Java `Collections` library and the new list is displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:
![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/filterSeqDiag.png)

_Notes:_
_In our example, `sort size asc` sorts the list of contacts by ascending potential business size,
which means that contacts with smaller potential business will appear near the top.
This could prove useful for our target users - Salesmen - where they would like to focus more attention on clients who potentially bring in more business.
The sort feature allows them to quickly view their contacts by business size accordingly._

#### Design considerations

1. Users would like to be able to sort by:
   1. the potential size of leads/business
      1. ascending order - to allow salesman to focus on improving weak leads
      2. descending order - to allow salesman to focus on capitalising on the best opportunities
   2. Name - for admin purposes
   3. Past transaction count
      1. History: Being able to keep track of transaction counts allows the salesman to see who are his most loyal or familiar clients.
   4. Priority
      1. Having specified the priority of which to take action, sorting by highest priority quickly lets the salesman see his most important clients.
2. Users would also be able to edit their clients/persons details
   1. This would be achievable with the [`edit` feature](#edit) 

#### Why this implementation

### Increment/Decrement  feature

#### Implementation
The proposed feature will allow users to increment the transaction counts of existing contacts, without the need for manual calculation. 
For the sake of convenience, explanation of the feature will be in terms of the increment variant. However, the decrement variant works similarly, and differences will be highlighted in the succeeding discussion.

The increment/decrement command takes in an  `index` and an  `AMOUNT_TO_INCREMENTED`. This  `AMOUNT_TO_INCREMENTED` is demarcated with a prefix `tr/`.
The activity diagram below describes how the increment feature works. 

<img src="images/IncrementCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

Given below 
The following sequence diagram shows how the increment operation works:
![IncrementSequenceDiagram](images/IncrementCommandSequenceDiagram.png) 

_Notes:_
_For the decrement function, the activity and sequence diagram works similarly, however, what constitues a valid amount to increment and decrement might differ. We must check in the case of decrement that fianl amount <= current and for increment final amount >= current._

#### Design considerations

1. If users use the edit feature to modify transaction counts, which could be very large values, they are required to calculate the final values themselves, which diminishes the utility from using such an app. 
Therefore, the increment command was created so that user will be exempt from making such calculation errors.
2. Furthermore, if users prematurely increment the transaction count, and subsequent transactions are cancelled /merged, they would require a decrement command to change the transaction count back in an error-free way. 
3. The syntax should be relatively similar to the edit command, since user should already be used to the prefix names. Hence, the command was designed to have minimal deviation from the edit command. 


#### Why this implementation

A main modify transaction count was considered in the case of implementing this feature. However, because of the edit, no additional functionality to the user is provided with such an implementation. 
An abstract class or interface was considered for this implementation. However, for the sake of making the code more extensible in the future, it seems that implementing them as two distinct commands will work better.
This is because most of the commonalities are already captured in the command class, and the edit command. Hence, letting despite the fact that letting these commands use the edit commands functions might increase coupling, it is better since the edit commands are already well tested.
If new functions would be made just for these commands, they would not be as well tested and moreover contain very similar logic. 


### Mark/Unmark feature

#### Implementation

The proposed feature will allow users to mark certain contacts they have in NBF as needing follow-ups or to unmark them as no need to follow-up.

The mark/unmark command takes in an `index` and a `YES/NO`, which is demarcated with a prefix `m/`, which is used to inform the model to mark or to unmark the specified contact. More simply, `m/yes` marks that contact and `m/no` unmarks the contact.

The activity diagram below describes how the mark feature works.

![MarkActivityDiagram](images/MarkActivityDiagram.png)

Given below
The following sequence diagram shows how the marking operation works:
![MarkSequenceDiagram](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)

_Notes:_

#### Design considerations

1. Sometimes users may forget if a contact they have in NBF is marked or unmarked, and proceed to mark or umark the contact again respectively. This may cause the contact to unmarked / marked, opposite of the user's intention. Hence an error message is shown, informing the user that the spcified contact is already marked or unmarked, and the original marking of the specified contact does not change.
2. When adding a new contact into NBF using `add`, the new contact is marked as requiring follow-ups by default. This is so that the user does not get overwhelmed with all the fields that need to be filled in with the `add` command. Furthermore, it doesn't make sense for new contacts to not need any follow-ups in the general case.
3. Instead of using `unmark`, the `mark` command is implemented with an addition field `m/ YES/NO` to indicate to mark or to unmark. This is to simplify the model by using 1 command to do both things.

#### Why this implementation

This feature adds functionality for users, as it allows the user to easily check for which contacts require following-up, by using this command in combination with the `find` command.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

Evolve AB3 into a lightweight CRM / Contact manager for a company's sales department.
#### The AB3 Evolution: NextBigFish (NBF) 
is a desktop app tailored for the needs of sales-people, supporting the management of contacts, leads or clients ** 
and optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, NBF can get your client and lead management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. 
NBF allows client contacts to hold data on their potential business size and counts of past transactions and aids users in categorising them using tags.
On top of that, NBF also provides a summary page to allow users to quickly get an overview of their performance each season, detailing relevant statistics.

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of business contacts
* has clients, for example, a salesman or an agent
* has a need to keep track of leads from clients
* has a need to learn statistics of leads
* needs to prioritise leads
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Managing and keeping track of leads by salesmen contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
