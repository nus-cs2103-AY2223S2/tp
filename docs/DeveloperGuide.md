### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/Redo Feature

#### Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `StackUndoRedo`. The implemented undo/redo feature would be best described as two stacks of commands that the user has performed:

- `undoStack` serves to store a "history" of the commands they have performed.
- `redoStack` is a collection of their commands that lead up to initial condition at which they started performing the undo.

The central concept is to store a stack of commands that essentially functions as a history-list of the commands. Essentially, we leverage on the stack's data structure of the which is a linear data structure that is based on the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). Based on the implementation described above, `undoStack` is populated by pushing a user's command in the application.

Then, when the user performs an undo, the command is firstly popped from `undoStack` and used to restore previous state, and then we store that command onto `redoStack`.

`StackUndoRedo` contains 2 stacks, `undoStack` and `redoStack`. The `undoStack` and `redoStack` contain commands that are of type `RedoableCommand`. `RedoableCommand` extends Command and has the following attributes and methods.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

When a `RedoableCommand` is being executed, the methods `saveAddressBookSnapshot(Model model)` will be called. This ensures that the current states are stored within the command.

After a command is executed, it will be added into the `StackUndoRedo`. The specific process is explained in the activity diagram below.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

Next, when undo is being performed, `undoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `redoStack`. It will then call `RedoableCommand` `undo()` of the command that is removed. The `undo()` method will then set the model to the previous snapshot of `saveAddressBookSnapshot`.

Likewise, when redo is being performed, `redoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `undoStack`. It will then call `RedoableCommand` `redo()` of the command that is removed. The `redo()` method will then execute the command again.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `StackUndoRedo` will be initialized.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

Step 2. The user executes delete command. The delete command will be pushed into the `StackUndoRedo`.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

Step 3. The user executes add customer command to add a new customer.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

Step 4. The user now decides that adding of customer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the undo command.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*


> <b>Note:</b> undoCommand will check if there is any command that can be undone by calling `StackUndoRedo` canUndo() method.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

> <b>Note:</b> The redo command will call `popRedo()` method in `StackUndoRedo`and `redo()` method in `RedoableCommand` .

Step 5. The user executes clear. Due to not being an `UndoCommand` or `RedoCommand`, it causes the `redoStack` to be cleared.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

Step 6. User executes list command. Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`.

*UndoRedoImage to be added soon*

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Implementation is easy.
    * Cons: Memory usage may cause performance issues.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command has attached logic that allows it to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. just save what is being deleted).
    * Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct. Adds a lot of complexity that may not seem justified as it is to only accomodate the undo/redo feature.

**Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use 2 stacks to store the history of the Models.
    * Pros: Implementation is easier and the logic would be much more manageable to debug.
    * Cons: Duplicated Logic.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo.
    * Pros: Does not need to maintain separate stacks and able to use what is in the codebase.
    * Cons: Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns are violated as `HistoryManager` would need to handle two different things._
