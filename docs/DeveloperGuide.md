### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and
[`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `del-doc 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramUpdated.png" width="574" alt="ArchitectureSeqDiagramUpdated" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of multiple smaller components. Some notable examples are
`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `ContactDisplay`. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that
represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching
`.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component does the following

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Doctor` or `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

#### Main Window
{: .no_toc}

The `MainWindow` houses all the components that make up the visual display of Docedex. Its primary
function is to listen to user input through the `CommandBox`, initiate the execution of the command,
and display the result through the `ResultDisplay` and/or `ContactDisplay`.

Here is a table containing a brief description of the purpose of the smaller components within `MainWindow`.

| **Name of component** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CommandBox`          | Allows users to enter Docedex commands.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `ResultDisplay`       | Provides CLI-based feedback upon a user command.<br/>Allows users to see if their command was successful or not.<br/>Provides error messages to guide user on how to use Docedex commands. |
| `ContactDisplay`      | Contains components that provide visual feedback upon manipulation of doctors and patients.<br/><br/>More details about these components can be found [here](#contact-display).            |
| `HelpWindow`          | Displays a help window containing a link to the User Guide.                                                                                                                                |
| `StatusBarFooter`     | Shows the location of the Docedex storage.                                                                                                                                                 |

The implementations of `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, and `HelpWindow` are relatively
straightforward. Therefore, this guide will not dive deeper into how these components are implemented.

#### Contact Display
{: .no_toc}

The `ContactDisplay` houses all the components that provide visual feedback after the manipulation
of doctors and patients within Docedex.

Here is a table containing a brief description of the purpose of the smaller components within `ContactDisplay`.

| **Name of component**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DoctorListPanel`         | Shows a list of `DoctorCard`. This list can be manipulated through commands.<br/><br/>Upon starting the app, this list will reflect all doctors in Docedex.<br/><br/>Upon selection of a `PatientCard`, this list will filter to show doctors assigned to said patient.  |
| `DoctorCard`              | Displays key information about a doctor, such as name, phone number, email and tags.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `PatientCard`             | Displays key information about a patient, such as name, phone number, email and tags.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard`  | Displays all information about a selected doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `EnlargedPatientInfoCard` | Displays all information about a selected patient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Here is a class diagram of how these components come together within the `ContactDisplay`.

![Structure of the Contact Display](images/ContactDisplayClassDiagram.png)

How the `ContactDisplay` works:

1. Upon a user command through the `CommandBox`, the `setFeedbackToUser(CommandResult commandResult)` method
   takes in the result of the command entered. The `CommandResult` contains information on whether the command
   requires an update to the GUI. If such an update is required, `ContactDisplay` will proceed to update
   all relevant components.
2. Upon a mouse click on a `DoctorCard` or `PatientCard`, the following sequence of actions is similar to
   that described above. However, instead of `setFeedbackToUser(CommandResult commandResult)` being called,
   either `setFeedbackUponSelectingDoctor(Doctor doctor)` or `setFeedbackUponSelectingPatient(Patient patient)`
   is called respectively.

To illustrate how these interactions work, let's say that the user selects a doctor through the `sd` command.
The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `ContactDisplay` component upon such a command.

![Sequence Diagram of the Contact Display Upon Command](images/ContactDisplaySequenceDiagram.png)

Upon a user command, we see from the diagram that the `setFeedbackToUser(CommandResult commandResult)` method
accomplished the following:

- Update filtered patients list in `LogicManager` to show the patients assigned to the selected doctor.
- Select the requested doctor within the `DoctorListPanel`. (This is a purely cosmetic selection, to provide
  visual feedback to the user)
- Update the `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard` to display the information of the selected doctor.
- Place the updated `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard` onto the placeholder `StackPane` which resides on the right-most
  column of the `ContactDisplay`. For more information on this specific step, click [here](#enlarged-info-card-feature).

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="450" alt="LogicClassDiagram"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddDoctorCommand`)
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a doctor).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-doc 1")`
API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `del-doc 1` Command](images/DeleteDoctorSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteDoctorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600" alt="ParserClasses"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddDoctorCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddDoctorCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser`
  returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddDoctorCommandParser`, `DeleteDoctorCommandParser`, ...) inherit from
  the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/UpdatedModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" alt="UpdatedModelClassDiagram"/>

<img src="images/PersonPackageClassDiagram.png" alt="PersonPackageClassDiagram" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Doctor` and `Patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueDoctorList`
  and `UniquePatientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Doctor` and `Patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate
  _filteredDoctors_ and _filteredPatients_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an
  unmodifiable `ObservableList<Doctor>` and `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![Structure of the Storage](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component does the following:

* Saves both address book and user preference data in JSON format after every command
* Read saved data and create the corresponding objects when starting up Docedex.

Notes about the `Storage` component

* Inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as
  either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's
  job is to save/load objects that belong to the `Model`)

#### Notes about storing assignments between doctors and patients
{: .no_toc}

In our `Model`, the `Doctor` contains a list of `Patient` that they are assigned to,
and the `Patient` contains a list of `Doctor` that they are assigned to.

However, this causes issues when we try to store these objects as is, since the bidirectional
navigability will result in an endless loop if we try to convert these objects into their JSON
format. While the creation of an association class to store information about assignment is ideal,
this will be implemented in the future due to time constraints.

Therefore, as of v1.4, `Storage` only stores the information of assignment within the `JsonAdaptedDoctor`.
In essence, it stores the doctors together with their assigned patients. So each doctor will have a JSON key
named `patients` that stores a dictionary of `JsonAdaptedPatient` that represent each assigned patient.

That leaves us with the unassigned patients within the `Model`. These patients are stored separately
under another JSON key named `unassignedPatients`.

`JsonAdaptedPatient` does not store any information about the doctors that were assigned to each patient.

## **Implementation**

### Add Doctor Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Adds a doctor to the bottom of the list of currently existing doctors. Users are able to add any valid doctor to the
list. If a record of the same doctor already exists in the list, the command will not be allowed and an error will be
thrown to alert user.

Example Use: `add-doc n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com s/Cardiology y/5 t/surgeon`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the add doctor command, an `AddDoctorCommand` class is created. The `AddDoctorCommand` class extends the
abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. Upon execution of this method, a `Doctor` object is
added to the model’s list of doctors if all the attributes provided are valid and a duplicate instance does not exist.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add doctor command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `add-doc n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com s/Cardiology y/5 t/surgeon` to save a doctor.

Step 3. The doctor is added to the model’s list of doctors if valid.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the add doctor operation works:

![](images/AddDoctorSequenceDiagram.png)
*args: Refers to a valid sequence of arguments provided by the user. Example: "n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com
s/Cardiology y/5 t/surgeon"

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Add Patient Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Adds a patient to the bottom of the list of currently existing patients. Users are able to add any valid patient to the
list. If a record of the same patient already exists in the list, the command will not be allowed and an error will be
thrown to alert user.

Example
Use: `add-ptn n/John Doe p/98765432 e/jdoe@gmail.com h/1.85 w/70.5 d/Fever st/Outpatient r/Patient was given paracetamol for fever t/friends`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the add patient command, an `AddPatientCommand` class is created. The `AddPatientCommand` class extends
the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. Upon execution of this method, a `Patient` object is
added to the model’s list of patients if all the attributes provided are valid and a duplicate instance does not exist.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add doctor command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User
executes `add-ptn n/John Doe p/98765432 e/jdoe@gmail.com h/1.85 w/70.5 d/Fever st/Outpatient r/Patient was given paracetamol for fever t/friends`
to save a patient.

Step 3. The patient is added to the model’s list of patients if valid.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the add doctor operation works:

![](images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png)
*args: Refers to a sequence of valid arguments provided by the user. Example: "n/John Doe p/98765432 e/jdoe@gmail.com
h/1.85 w/70.5 d/Fever st/Outpatient r/Patient was given paracetamol for fever t/friends"

### Edit Doctor Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Users can edit specific doctors in the clinic by providing at least one of the optional fields. Existing values will be
updated to the input values and all other values will remain the same. The doctor to be edited can be specified through
the doctor's index.

Example Use: `edit-doc 2 n/Gabriel Tan p/12345678 s/Cardiology`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the edit doctor command, an `EditDoctorCommand` class is created. The `EditDoctorCommand` class extends
the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. The `EditDoctorDescriptor` is created with the
arguments given
by the user. A new `Doctor` object is created with the new arguments, with the attributes of the old `Doctor` object
copied over
if the argument for that specific attribute is not provided by the user. `EditDoctorDescriptor` is then passed
to `EditDoctorCommandParser`.
The `EditDoctorCommand` is created using the `EditDoctorDescriptor`. Upon execution of `EditDoctorCommand`, a `Doctor`
object is added to the model’s list of doctors if all the attributes provided are valid and a duplicate instance does
not exist.

The following activity diagram illustrates the user flow for editing a doctor:

![](images/EditDoctorActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add doctor command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `edit-doc n/Simon` to edit a doctor.

Step 3. The doctor is edited and saved to the model’s list of doctors if valid.

Step 4. filteredDoctorList is updated so that the UI can display the edited doctor.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the edit doctor operation works:

![](images/EditDoctorSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Doctor Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Deletes a doctor at the specified **one-based index** of list of currently existing/found doctors. Users are able to
delete any doctor in the list. If an index larger than or equal to the size of the doctor’s list is provided, the
command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown to alert user.

Example Use: `del-doc 1`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the delete doctor command, a `DeleteDoctorCommand` class is created. The `DeleteDoctorCommand` class
extends the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. Upon execution of this method, the doctor at
specified **one-based index** is removed if the index provided is valid.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete doctor command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `del-doc 1` to delete the doctor at index 1 (one-based indexing).

Step 3. The doctor at this index is removed if the index provided is valid.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the delete doctor operation works:

![](images/DeleteDoctorSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Patient Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Deletes a patient at the specified **one-based index** of list of currently existing/found patient. Users are able to
delete any patient in the list. If an index larger than or equal to the size of the patient’s list is provided, the
command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown to alert user.

Example Use: `del-ptn 1`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the delete doctor command, a `DeletePatientCommand` class is created. The `DeletePatientCommand` class
extends the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. Upon execution of this method, the patient
at specified **one-based index** is removed if the index provided is valid.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete patient command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `del-ptn 1` to delete the patient at index 1 (one-based indexing).

Step 3. The patient at this index is removed if the index provided is valid.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the delete patient operation works:

![](images/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.png)

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Assign Patient Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Assigns a patient at the specified **one-based index** of list of currently existing/found patient to a doctor at the specified **one-based index** of list of currently existing/found doctor. If indexes provided are larger or equal to the size of their respective lists, the command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown. If specified patient is already assigned to specified doctor, the command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown.

Example Use: `assign-ptn ptn/1 doc/1`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the assign patient command, a `AssignPatientCommand` class is created. The `AssignPatientCommand` class extends the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. Upon execution of this method, the patient at specified **one-based index** is assigned to the doctor at specified **one-based index** if both indexes provided are valid and the patient is not assigned to the doctor yet. The `AssignPatientCommand` class creates a new `Patient` object with the specific `Doctor` reference and a new `Doctor` object with the specific `Patient` reference. The previous `Patient` and `Doctor` objects are then replaced with the new `Patient` and `Doctor` objects.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the assign patient command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `assign-ptn ptn/1 doc/1` to assign the patient at index 1 to the doctor at index 1 (one-based indexing).

Step 3. If the indexes provided are valid and patient is not assigned to doctor yet, the patient at index 1 is replaced with a patient with doctor reference and the doctor at index 1 is replaced with a doctor with patient reference.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the assign patient operation works:

### Unassign Patient Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Unassigns a patient at the specified **one-based index** of list of currently existing/found patient from a doctor at the specified **one-based index** of list of currently existing/found doctor. If indexes provided are larger or equal to the size of their respective lists, the command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown. If specified patient is not assigned to specified doctor, the command will not be allowed and an error will be thrown.

Example Use: `unassign-ptn ptn/1 doc/1`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the unassign patient command, a `UnassignPatientCommand` class is created. The `UnassignPatientCommand` class extends the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method. Upon execution of this method, the patient at specified **one-based index** is unassigned from the doctor at specified **one-based index** if both indexes provided are valid and the patient is assigned to the doctor. The `AssignPatientCommand` class creates a new `Patient` object without the specific `Doctor` reference and a new `Doctor` object without the specific `Patient` reference. The previous `Patient` and `Doctor` objects are then replaced with the new `Patient` and `Doctor` objects.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the unassign patient command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `unassign-ptn ptn/1 doc/1` to unassign the patient at index 1 from the doctor at index 1 (one-based indexing).

Step 3. If the indexes provided are valid and patient is assigned to doctor, the patient at index 1 is replaced with a patient without doctor reference and the doctor at index 1 is replaced with a doctor without patient reference.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the unassign patient operation works:

### Find Doctor Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Finds a doctor with the specified parameters. 

Example Use: `find-doc n/Alice`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the find doctor command, a `FindDoctorCommand` class is created. The `FindDoctorCommand` class takes a predicate created by `DoctorContainsKeywordsPredicate` class. The `FindDoctorCommand` class extends the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method which updates the model's list of filtered doctors.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the find doctor command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `find-doc n/Alice` to find a doctor with the name Alice.

Step 3. The model's list of filtered doctors is updated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the find doctor operation works:

![](images/FindDoctorSequenceDiagram.png)

*args: Refers to a valid sequence of arguments provided by the user. Example: "n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com

### Find Patient Feature

#### What it does
{: .no_toc}

Finds a patient with the specified parameters.

Example Use: `find-ptn n/Bob`

#### Implementation
{: .no_toc}

Upon entry of the find patient command, a `FindPatientCommand` class is created. The `FindPatientCommand` class takes a predicate created by `PatientContainsKeywordsPredicate` class. The `FindPatientCommand` class extends the abstract `Command` class and implements the `execute()` method which updates the model's list of filtered patients.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the find patient command behaves at each step.

Step 1. User launches the application

Step 2. User executes `find-ptn n/Bob` to find a patient with the name Bob.

Step 3. The model's list of filtered patients is updated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the find patient operation works:

### GUI Features

#### Enlarged Info Card feature
{: .no_toc}

As triage staff manage the contacts of doctors and patients, they may wish to pull up
the information related to the doctor or patient. Therefore, the right-most column within
Docedex has been reserved to show the personal information of the selected doctor or patient.

![](images/NewUi.png)

##### Brief introduction to the components involved
{: .no_toc}

Let's call the card which displays this information **info cards**. However, the information
displayed for a doctor compared to a patient has a few differences. Thus, two different info cards
are required - one to display patient information and one to display doctor information.

Let's call these cards `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard` and `EnlargedPatientInfoCard`. However, we
only have one `StackPane` to display the information of the queried doctor or patient. This
`StackPane` spans over the right-most column seen in the GUI above, and serves as a placeholder
for the info cards. So, we now need a way to toggle between displaying either card, depending
on whether the user has selected a doctor or patient to view.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

##### Exploring the user journey
{: .no_toc}

To explore how this is implemented, we will focus on the user clicking on a `DoctorListViewCell`
representing a doctor, though the ideas below can be extended to the user clicking on a
`PatientListViewCell`, as well as other ways of querying for a doctor or patient
(ie. through [`sd`](./UserGuide.md#select-doctor) or [`sp`](./UserGuide.md#select-patient) command).

Below, we see the sequence diagram of how a mouse click from the user on the `DoctorListViewCell`
causes the display of information related to the doctor card through the `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard`.

![](images/UserClickDoctorCardSequenceDiagram.png)

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

##### More details on implementation
{: .no_toc}

Before diving into the details, here are a few key points to note:

- The `ContactDisplay` contains all three columns shown in the middle of the GUI.
  These columns represent the doctors list, patients list and an info card respectively,
  from left to right.
- There is always only one instance of the `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard`,
  `EnlargedPatientInfoCard`, `ContactDisplay` and placeholder `StackPane`.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When the user clicks on a `DoctorListViewCell`, the `setFeedbackUponSelectingDoctor()`
call initiates the process of updating the relevant UI components to display
information about the doctor. As part of this function, the `ContactDisplay` updates the
doctor displayed in the `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard`. Lastly, the `ContactDisplay` clears the
current display within the placeholder `StackPane`, and adds the `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard`
as the child node of the `StackPane`.

At the end of this journey, the `EnlargedDoctorInfoCard` containing the information
of the selected doctor is displayed on the right-most column on the Docedex GUI.

A similar process happens when the user clicks on a `PatientListViewCell`, with
the `EnlargedPatientInfoCard` being populated with the appropriate data and displayed instead.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

##### Alternatives considered
{: .no_toc}

In the past, we had a different implementation of this feature, where the `DoctorListViewCell`
called a function in a controller named `EnlargedInfoCardController` instead of the `ContactDisplay`.
The controller would be in charge of keeping the state of whether to display the doctor or patient.
All UI components would then refer to this controller to update themselves.

However, upon implementation, it was realised that the `ContactDisplay` contained all the UI components
that needs to be updated when a user selects a doctor or patient. Therefore, it was simpler and more
purposeful to let the `ContactDisplay` handle this update. Hence, the controller was removed and the
current design was favoured.

## **Appendix A: Planned Enhancements**

### Feedback to User

#### Problem 1: Selection of doctor or patient cards is not cleared upon certain commands

- **Scenario**: User selected a patient on Docedex, before entering `list-doc`.
- **What you see**: All the doctors in Docedex are listed on the GUI, as requested by the `list-doc` command.
  However, the user interface does not clear the selection of the previously selected patient card.
- **Potential issue**: Confusion may arise on whether the listed doctors are assigned
  to the previously selected patient.
- **Why did it happen**: `list-doc` did not clear the previous selection of patient cards.

Note: This issue exists for the all commands that do not involve selection of doctor
or patient cards (ie. [`list-doc`](./UserGuide.md#listing-all-doctors),
[`find-doc`](./UserGuide.md#finding-a-doctor), [`del-doc`](./UserGuide.md#deleting-a-doctor),
[`list-ptn`](./UserGuide.md#listing-all-patients), [`find-ptn`](./UserGuide.md#finding-a-patient)
or [`del-ptn`](./UserGuide.md#deleting-a-patient)).

**Solution:** Any commands that do not involve selection of doctor or patient cards will
clear selection of all patient and doctor cards.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Problem 2: Titles of patient/doctor lists do not well describe its contents

- **Scenario**: User adds a doctor using the [`add-doc` command](./UserGuide.md#adding-a-doctor).
- **What you see**: Docedex automatically selects the newly added doctor. Selection of a doctor
  will result in an update to the patients list, as described [here](./UserGuide.md#selecting-doctors-or-patients-through-commands).
  Since the newly added doctor has no assigned patients, the patients list is cleared.
- **Potential issue**: Confusion may arise as no visual feedback is provided that the patients list is
  reflecting the newly added doctor's assigned patients. Previously, some users have confused this
  behaviour with all patients being deleted from Docedex.
- **Why did it happen**: Titles of patient/doctor lists is not updated to describe the contents of
  the list upon user input.

Note to users and developers: This problem exists if you add a patient using `add-ptn` too.

**Solution:** The title of the patients list will be updated to display "XXX's Patients"
when any doctor is selected, where XXX is the name of the doctor. The same fix will be done for the
displayed doctors list upon selection of patients.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Problem 3: The command usage message is not consistent across the UserGuide and EditXYZCommands

- **Scenario**: User enters an invalid variation of the `edit-doc` or `edit-ptn` commands
- **What you see**: Error message that does not indicate that the entry of only one update parameter is compulsory while all
  others are optional.
- **Potential issue**: User assumes that all fields are compulsory
- **Why did it happen**: Implementation of feature freeze prior to resolution

**Solution:** Update the `MESSAGE_USAGE` field
in [`EditDoctorCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditDoctorCommand.java), [`EditPatientCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditPatientCommand.java)
and associated
tests ([`EditDoctorCommandTest`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditDoctorCommandTest.java), [`EditPatientCommandTest`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditPatientCommandTest.java))
with parameter information and notation present in the [UserGuide](./UserGuide.md#editing-a-doctor) and the
line `"At least one parameter other than INDEX should be provided\n"`.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Problem 4: Better error/exception handling for invalid command inputs
- **Scenario**: User enters an invalid variation of a command
- **What you see**: Error message that does not indicate which parameter/section of the command is invalid.
- **Potential issue**: User has to guess which parameter/section of the command is invalid.
- **Why did it happen**: Implementation of feature freeze prior to resolution

**Solution**: Allow Command classes and associated parser utils to throw error messages of parameter/section of command that is invalid.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Scalability

#### Enhancement 1: Use of association classes instead of lists to capture doctor-patient relationship on assignment

- **Current**: Doctor and patient assignments are currently being stored using a list inside each instance of a Doctor and Patient class. For example, if patient1 is assigned to doctor1, patient1 will have doctor1 in its list of doctors and vice versa.
- **Proposed**: A DoctorPatient class which models assignments between doctors and patients.
- **Justification**: Although the current solution is sufficient to capture the relationships between a doctor and a person at this version of Docedex, in future iterations of Docedex, we may want to store more information about the details of the assignment between a doctor and a patient, such as the date. We may even want to want the patient's case details to be specific based on the assignment. An association class can help make creating these new features more scalable and easier to implement.
  ![Proposed new DoctorPatient class](images/ProposedNewModelDiagram.png)


[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Enhancement 2: Validation for find command

- **Current**: Users are allowed to type any search query using the find command.
- **Proposed**: Limit search queries according to the parameter constraints.
- **Justification**: The current find command gives an empty list when search queries which do not fit the original parameter constraints are given. This is the expected behavior. An enhancement to the find query would be to give users a more specific error message as to why the find command gives an empty list.

## **Appendix B: Product scope**

**Target user profile:**
We hope to target admin staff within a clinic who have to settle triaging of patients.<br>
Here are some characteristics of our target user profile: <br>

* needs to manipulate patient and doctor information quickly
* needs to assign patients to the appropriate doctors quickly
* prefer desktop apps over other mediums
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Perform quick lookup and assignment of appropriate doctors to each patient in triage,
faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

## **Appendix G: Effort**

| Feature       | AB3 | Docedex |
|---------------|-----|---------|
| Effort        | 10  | 22      |
| Lines of Code | 6k  | +13k    |

The Docedex project involved a significant effort to adapt the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) application to a new domain of doctors and patients. One of the major changes was the addition of two new models, Doctor and Patient, which required modifying the existing data model and the associated logic components. Another significant change was the complete redesign of the user interface using JavaFX, which required a significant amount of time and effort to learn and implement.

Firstly, although code was reused from AB3, a lot of it had to be refactored to fit our use case. We now had to deal with 2 entity types, patient and doctor, which meant that the way we stored the information also had to change. Moreover, with more attributes for both `Doctor` and `Patient` classes, it also meant more effort in validating the inputs and writing high quality test cases for each attribute, an extremely time-consuming process.

The most significant challenge was to map a many-to-many relationship between doctors and patients during assignment. To solve this, the team decided to create a list of patients inside each Doctor instance (and vice versa for patients). This change required us to modify multiple components to update the lists after patient assignment and display them onto the UI.

Our work on implementing the assignment feature is the most prominent in the AssignDoctorCommand and AssignPatientCommand, and their relevant parsers and model methods.

Another challenge was redesigning the interface to display more information. Changing the interface of an application can be a major undertaking. In the case of Docedex, this involved designing new UI components, updating existing components to reflect the new models and data, and potentially creating new navigation and layout structures to support the new workflows. Significant time was taken to learn JavaFX and implementing the components to fit Docedex use cases.

We even tried to add test cases to the UI, following AB4 example closely. This can be seen in an open pull request which we have intentionally chosen to not merge because we felt that the complexity in implementing the test cases extended beyond the objectives of the module, and we did not want to submit half completed work.
