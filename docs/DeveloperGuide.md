### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components and an extra `Importer` component.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`Importer`**](#importer-component): Imports data from export files.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

**NOTE**: The `Importer` class works separately and is described in further detail below.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Importer Component
**API**: [`Importer.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Importer.java)

<img src="images/ImporterClassDiagram.png" width="150" />

The `Importer` component,
* is used to import data from export files
* is only used by the specific command `ImportCommand` in order to read the data from the given export file.


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### \[Developed\] Group create

The group create feature allows users to create group. Only one group can be created at a time.
This is implemented using the `GroupCreateCommand`, `GroupCreateCommandParser` and
`UniqueGroupList` classes.

The `GroupCreateCommand` receives a `Group` to be added into `UniqueGroupList`.

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a group create command:

<img src="images/GroupCreateCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="200" />

#### Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute API call.

<img src="images/GroupCreateCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to
   parse the user command.
2. If the user command has the group create `COMMAND_WORD`, the `AddressBookParser` creates a `GroupCreateCommandParser`
to parse the user input.
3. If `GroupCreateCommandParser` parse the command successfully, it creates a `GroupCreateCommand` and initialise it
with a `Group`.
4. The `GroupCreateCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `GroupCreateCommand` instance which adds the `Group` into the
   `UniqueGroupList` (If group does not exist).
6. Execution of `GroupCreateCommand` results in a `CommandResult` created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: Creating multiple groups**
* **Alternative 1:** Create multiple `Group` in one user command.
    * Pros:
      * Users can create multiple groups at once instead of creating each group one at a time.
    * Cons:
      * More bug-prone due to duplicate groups.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Only allow one group to be added in one user command.
    * Note: If user input more than one group, only the last group will be added.
    * Pros:
      * Easy to implement.
      * Less bug-prone as only one group has to be checked for validity.
    * Cons:
      * Users have to key in the `group_create` command multiple times if they want to create multiple groups.

* **Justification**
    * As the other parameters such as phone and number only take the last occurrence of an input, it is best to
      standardise the same for groups as well.
    * Reduces the length of command input for users as they are prone to input duplicate groups in one command.

**Aspect: Creating new group through add command**
* **Alternative 1:** Create a new `Group` using the existing add command.
    * Pros:
      * Lesser commands for users to use
      * Easier to implement
    * Cons:
      * More bug-prone due to having multiple parameters to check including group

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Create a new `Group` using a new command 'group_create'.
    * Pros:
      * Dedicated command for creating a group
      * Less bug-prone as the only input is one group instead of having multiple information such as name, email etc.
    * Cons:
      * Users need to create a group first before adding a person to it.

* **Justification**
    * As the add command is relatively lengthy, having more input parameters would result in users creating a wrong group.
    * Having a dedicated command for creating groups is less bug-prone as it only has to check for the validity of one group

### \[Developed\] Group delete

The group delete feature allows users to delete a group and remove persons from that group.
Only one group can be deleted at a time.

This is implemented using the `GroupDeleteCommand`, `GroupDeleteCommandParser` and
`UniqueGroupList` classes.

The `GroupDeleteCommand` receives an `Index` of a `Group` to be deleted from the `UniqueGroupList`.

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a group delete command:

<img src="images/GroupDeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="200" />

#### Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute API call.

<img src="images/GroupDeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to
   parse the user command.
2. If the user command has the group delete `COMMAND_WORD`, the `AddressBookParser` creates a `GroupDeleteCommandParser`
to parse the user input.
3. If `GroupDeleteCommandParser` parse the command successfully, it creates a `GroupDeleteCommand` and initialise it
with an `Index`.
4. The `GroupDeleteCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `GroupDeleteCommand` instance which deletes the `Group` from the
   `UniqueGroupList` (If the group exist).
6. Execution of `GroupDeleteCommand` results in a `CommandResult` created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: Deleting multiple groups**
* **Alternative 1:** Delete multiple `Group` in one user command.
    * Pros:
      * Users can delete multiple groups at once instead of deleting each group one at a time.
    * Cons:
      * More bug-prone due to multiple index given by user
      * Once a group is deleted, the index will shift, this will cause errors.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Only allow one group to be deleted in one user command.
    * Pros:
      * Easy to implement.
      * Less bug-prone as only one index has to be checked for validity
    * Cons:
      * Users have to key in the `group_delete` command multiple times if they want to create multiple groups.

* **Justification**
    * When a group is deleted, the index of the groups will shift. Continuing to delete the remaining groups
  based on index would result in the wrong group deleted.
    * Handling the offset of the index due to a group deleted is challenging as users may not key in the index in
  numerical order.
    
### \[Developed\] Find group(s)

The find group feature allows users to find group(s) and persons who are in those group(s).

This is implemented using the `GroupFindCommand`, `GroupFindCommandParser`, `UniqueGroupList` and `UniquePersonList`
classes.

The `GroupFindCommand` receives a group and member predicate,

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a group find command:

<img src="images/GroupFindCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute API call.

<img src="images/GroupFindCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to
   parse the user command.
2. If the user command has the group find `COMMAND_WORD`, the `AddressBookParser` creates a `GroupFindCommandParser`
   to parse the user input.
3. If `GroupFindCommandParser` parse the command successfully, it creates`GroupFindCommand` and initialise it with
`GroupNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `MemberOfGroupPredicate`.
4. The `GroupFindCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `GroupFindCommand` instance which filters the `UniqueGroupList` and
`UniquePersonList` based on the group and member predicate
6. Execution of `GroupFindCommand` results in a `CommandResult` created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.

### \[Developed\] Editing a person

Users can edit a person's `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Group` and `Tag`.

**Note:** Editing a person's event uses another command. Explanation is given at the end.

This is implemented using the `EditCommand`, `EditPersonDescriptor` and `EditCommandParser` classes.

The `EditCommand` receives an index of the person to be edited and an editable `EditPersonDescriptor` class which
consists of the updated fields of the person.

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an edit command:

<img src="images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="200" />

#### Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute API call.

<img src="images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to
   parse the user command.
2. If the user command has the edit `COMMAND_WORD`, the `AddressBookParser`  creates an `EditCommandParser`
to parse the user input.
3. If `EditCommandParser` parse the command successfully, it creates a `EditCommand` and initialise it with
`EditPersonDescriptor`, `Index` and a boolean (shouldMerge).
4. The `EditCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `EditCommand` instance which edits the `Person` in the `UniquePersonList`.
If shouldMerge is true, it adds on groups and tags (if specified), otherwise it overwrites existing tags/groups.
6. Execution of `EditCommand` results in a `CommandResult` created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: Overwriting or merging**
* **Alternative 1:** Only allows group and tag to be overwritten.
  * Pros:
    * Easy implementation and reduces editing errors.
  * Cons:
    * Users had to retype every existing group/tag in addition to the new group/tag they want to include in.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Allows group and tag to be added on instead of overwritten.
   * Pros:
     * Users can just add on one or more group/tag instead of retyping existing group/tag.
   * Cons:
     * More bug-prone due to duplicate group/tag and adding to non-existing group.

* **Justification**
  * Users had to retype existing groups/tags plus additional groups/tags they want to add on to a person.
  * Reduces the length of command input for users by allowing them to add/merge without overwriting current groups/tags.

**Aspect: User command for GroupCommand**
* **Alternative 1:** Edit the group attribute of a person with a separate command.
   * Pros:
     * Reduce coupling.
   * Cons:
     * More commands for user to work with.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Edit the group attribute of a person using the existing edit command.
   * Pros:
     * Easy to implement
     * lesser commands for user to remember.
   * Cons:
     * Easy for user to make an erroneous command.

* **Justification**
  * As editing a group requires the same index as the existing `EditCommand`, it would be better to reuse the same
    command.
  * Lesser commands for users to remember.

#### Differences between editing a person and a person's event(s)
* As editing for events require two index, `[INDEX_OF_PERSON]` and `[INDEX_OF_EVENT]`, it is different from the
existing command.
* This significantly increases the chances of users inputting a wrong command
* Hence, editing events using a separate command from the existing `EditCommand` is more convenient and appropriate.

### \[Developed\] Adding Isolated Event

Users can add an isolated/non-recurring event. This is implemented using `AddIsolatedEventCommand`,
`AddIsolatedEventCommandParser` and `IsolatedEventList` classes.

The `AddIsolatedEventCommand` receives an isolated event to be added into the person's `IsolatedEventList`.

#### Activity diagram
The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an `event_create` command:

<img src="images/AddIsolatedEventCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction within the Logic component for the execute
API call.

<img src="images/AddIsolatedEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command mechanism behaves at each step.
1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command
`event_create 1 ie/biking f/26/03/2023 14:00 t/26/03/2023 15:00`, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the
user command.
2. Since the user command has the `event_create` command word, it is a valid command. The `AddressBookParser` creates an
   `AddIsolatedEventCommandParser` to parse the user input.
3. The `AddIsolatedEventCommandParser` will checks if the command is valid through the `parse()` method.
If it parses the command successfully, `AddIsolatedEventCommand` is created.
4. The `AddIsolatedEventCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`.
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `AddIsolatedEventCommand` instance which add the isolated event to the requested
person's IsolatedEventList.
6. Execution of `AddIsolatedEventCommand` results in a CommandResult created and returned to the LogicManager.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: Concern while adding a new command**
- Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

**Aspect: Should we allow isolated event's duration to span over multiple days**

* **Alternative 1:** Only allows isolated event to start and end on the same day.
    * Pros:
        * Easy implementation and will be easier to implement find free time slots.
    * Cons:
        * There will be instances when users will have event that span over multiple days such as travelling. Hence,
      it will reduce the user-friendliness if we restrict isolated events to be only one day long.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Allows isolated events' duration to span over two or more days.
    * Pros:
        * Users can just add one isolated event instead of adding the isolated event multiple times.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement finding free time slots.

### \[Developed\] Editing Isolated Event
This feature allows the user to edit a specific isolated event in the person's isolated event list.

#### Activity Diagram
The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an `ie_edit` command:

<img src="images/EditIsolatedEventCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction within the Logic component for the execute
API call.

<img src="images/EditIsolatedEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command mechanism behaves at each step.
1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command
   `ie_edit 1 1 ie/biking`, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the
   user command.
2. Since the user command has the `ie_edit` command word, it is a valid command. The `AddressBookParser` creates an
   `EditIsolatedEventCommandParser` to parse the user input.
3. The `EditIsolatedEventCommandParser` will checks if the command is valid through the `parse()` method.
   If it parses the command successfully, `EditIsolatedEventCommand` is created.
4. The `EditIsolatedEventCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`.
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `EditIsolatedEventCommand` instance which edit the isolated event to the
respective field requested.
6. Execution of `EditIsolatedEventCommand` results in a CommandResult created and returned to the LogicManager.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: Concern while adding a new command**
- Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

**Aspect: Should we edit isolated event using the existing EditCommand**

* **Alternative 1:** Use existing EditCommand for users' to edit isolated event.
    * Pros:
        * Fewer things to implement and reduce the instances of duplicating code.
    * Cons:
        * More prone to bugs.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Create a separate command to edit isolated event.
    * Pros:
        * Easier to debug.
    * Cons:
        * Some part of the code is the same as EditCommand.

### \[Developed\] Adding Recurring Event
User can add recurring events. Adding a recurring event is almost similar to the adding isolated event except that it is implemented using `AddRecurringEventCommand`,
`AddRecurringEventCommandParser` and `RecurringEventList`, `TimeMaksk`  classes.

The `AddRecurringEventCommand` receives a recurring event to be added into the person's `RecurringEventList` and updates the `TimeMask` in the perons's `RecurringEventList`.

#### Activity diagram
The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an `event_create_recur` command:

<img src="images/AddRecurringEventCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

The recurring event list is fix to span over 7 days from Monday to Sunday, while the isolated events in the list may span over an infinite amount of days.
Since there is only 7 days in the recurring event list, it would be guaranteed that the TimeMask will only have a maximum of 7 days. Therefore, updating the 
TimeMask while adding a recurring event is possible and convenient for finding free time slots.

#### Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction within the Logic component for the execute
API call.

<img src="images/AddRecurringEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command mechanism behaves at each step.
1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command
   `event_create_recur 1 ie/biking d/Monday 14:00 t/15:00`, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the
   user command.
2. Since the user command has the `event_create_recur` command word, it is a valid command. The `AddressBookParser` creates an
   `AddRecurringEventCommandParser` to parse the user input.
3. The `AddRecurringEventCommandParser` will checks if the command is valid through the `parse()` method.
   If it parses the command successfully, `AddRecurringEventCommand` is created.
4. The `AddRecurringEventCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`.
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `AddRecurringEventCommand` instance which add the recurring event to the requested
   person's `RecurringEventList` and updates the `TimeMask` in the person's `RecurringEventList`.
6. Execution of `AddRecurringEventCommand` results in a CommandResult created and returned to the LogicManager.

#### Design consideration
**Aspect: Concern while adding a new command**
- Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

**Aspect: Should we allow recurring event's duration to span over multiple days**

* **Alternative 1:** Allows recurring events' duration to span over two or more days.
    * Pros:
        * Users can just add one recurring event instead of adding the recurring event multiple times.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement finding free time slots.
      

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Only allows recurring event to start and end on the same day.
    * Pros:
        * Easy implementation and will be easier to implement find free time slots.
        * Having an event be fixed to one day is less prone to bugs
    * Cons:
        * There will be instances when users will have event that span over multiple days such as studying overnight 
          from 23:00 to 01:00. Hence, it will reduce the user-friendliness if we restrict isolated events to be only one day long.

### \[Developed\] Finding free time slots
This feature allows a user to display unoccupied time slots shared by members of a group.

Time slot finding feature requires a few pre-processing steps to function with efficiency.
Instead of traversing through the IsolatedEvents and RecurringEvents of each Person in the Group, it would be a better to have some an auxiliary table to reduce computation. 
The current implementation uses the idea of a bitmask to determine which intervals are occupied. A TimeMask is simply an array of 7 numbers, each reflecting the occupancy of each time slot (1 hour each) throughout a day. Thus, it reflects the occupancies of each time slot in a week. The ordering of the days follow that of Javaâ€™s DayOfWeek API where Monday has the lowest value of 1. The first number in the array then represents Monday, the second represents Tuesday and so on. Each Personâ€™s RecurringEventList will then maintain a TimeMask that gets updated whenever a RecurringEvent is added for that Person. 

#### Activity Diagram
The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a `free` command:

<img src="images/FindTimeCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

When the FindTimeCommand executes with a Group and Date as its parameters,
1. A empty parent TimeMask is created, meaning that all time slots in the 7 days are unoccupied by default. 
2. Then iterate through all Persons in the UniquePersonList and if they are members of the specified Group:
   a. Check the Person's RecurringEventList and get its TimeMask and merge with the parent TimeMask. This is done by comparing all 7 integers, each representing a day, doing a bitwise OR operation.
   b. Check through the Person's IsolatedEventList for any events that fall within 7 days from the specified Date and update the corresponding integer in the parent TimeMask. 
3. The parent TimeMask is then converted to a list of unoccupied time slots, and it is updated in the AddressBook's ScheduleWeek, that acts as an internal list that UI observes.
4. The UI detects the changes and then displays the updated timetable.

#### Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction within the Logic component for the execute
API call for FindTimeCommand.

<img src="images/FindTimeCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command mechanism behaves at each step.
1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command
   `free 1 f/04/04/2023`, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the
   user command.
2. Since the user command has the `free` command word, it is a valid command. The `AddressBookParser` creates an
   `FindTimeCommandParser` to parse the user input.
3. The `FindTimeCommandParser` will checks if the command is valid through the `parse()` method.
   If it parses the command successfully, `FindTimeCommand` is created.
4. The `FindTimeCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`.
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `FindTimeCommand` instance which edit the isolated event to the
   respective field requested.
6. Execution of `FindTimeCommand` results in a CommandResult created and returned to the LogicManager.

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Algorithm and data structure for finding of free time slot**
* **Alternative 1: List of occupied intervals (start date time and end date time)**
    * With each command call, merge all the intervals of Events belonging to all Persons in a Group. The Events would be limited within a week from the date parameter in the FindTimeCommand. It helps that the EventLists are already sorted. The ideal approach would be to combine all the lists of Events, then sort them based on the start DateTime and then sieve through the list for any overlapping intervals and combine them.
    * Pros:
        * Allows free time output to be more flexible. The time slots do not have to follow the fixed granularity of 1 hour. Instead of hour time slots, there can be slots like '12:33 to 13:11'.
    * Cons:
        * More complex to implement. This requires maintenance of lists of non-overlapping intervals.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2: Use integers to store occupancy of daily time slots across the week**
    * Use bits of 1s and 0s to represent the occupancy of a time slot. Thus, use 24 bits of a int data type for a day and have 7 of them to represent a week.
    * Pros:
      * Allows for simpler and faster comparisons of schedules with the use of Bitwise operations
    * Cons:
      * Fixed time slot granularity of 1 hour, requiring them to follow the hourly format.
      * More complex to implement arbitrary granularity value, since int data type has a limit of 32 bits and exceeding that will cause overflow and thus cause unexpected calculation differences. It is only feasible to implement 0.5 hour granularity since a long data type can be used to cater 64 bits.

* **Justification**
    * Alternative 2 capitalizes on the property of RecurringEvents. It is more performant when users only has RecurringEvents and not IsolatedEvents. It may be more common and meaningful to find time slots that are recurring.
      * Losing flexibility in the range of time slots may not be that significant since users may not require it.

**Aspect: Additional storing of combined timetables**
* **Alternative: Store the calculated timetables in the corresponding Group**
  * Instead of having to recompute the timetables for Groups by checking every member, simply store them when they are calculated and retrieve directly when needed 
  * Pros: 
    * More efficient retrieval
  * Cons:
    * Bug-prone, requires more maintenance. 
      * There are a couple of factors involved that might affect the correctness of this approach. For example, if a person were to be removed from a group, it is not certain that the Group now has more free time slots since there may be other members who share the same occupied time slots. Suppose Alice and Bob are both in the â€˜CS2103â€™ Group and Alice has a recurring Lecture on Mondays from 1pm to 2pm. Alice has now been removed from the Group. We cannot update the shared â€˜CS2103â€™ Group to free the 1pm time slot, since Bob might also have the same Event. 
      * So, why not check if Bob has the same Event? It is then a possible approach to follow this implementation, but this requires extra checking of each memberâ€™s Events upon modification of any Groupâ€™s information.

* **Justification**
    * To ensure the correctness of our application within the insufficient amount of time remaining, we have decided not to implement this.

### \[Developed\] Export

The export feature allows users to export a person's details to a json file. Groups and tags are not exported.

This is implemented using the `ExportCommand`, `ExportCommandParser` and
`UniquePersonList` and `Storage` classes.

The `ExportCommand` receives an `Index` of a `Person` to be exported from the `UniquePersonList`.

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an export command:

#### Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute API call.

<img src="images/ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to
   parse the user command.
2. If the user command has the export `COMMAND_WORD`, the `AddressBookParser` creates a `ExportCommandParser`
   to parse the user input.
3. If `ExportCommandParser` parse the command successfully, it creates a `ExportCommand` and initialise it
   with an `Index`.
4. The `ExportCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `ExportCommand` instance which obtains the person from the 
   `UniquePersonList`.
6. Execution of `ExportCommand` results in a `CommandResult` created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.
7. `LogicManager` then passes the person obtained from `ExportCommand` to the method `exportPerson()` of `Storage`
8. `Storage` then creates a json file of the person to be exported in data/export.json

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: Exporting multiple persons**
* **Alternative 1:** Export multiple `Person` in one user command.
    * Pros:
        * Users can export multiple persons at once instead of exporting each person one at a time.
    * Cons:
        * More bug-prone due to multiple index given by user

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Only allow one person to be exported in one user command.
    * Pros:
        * Easy to implement.
        * Less bug-prone as only one index has to be checked for validity
    * Cons:
        * Users have to export one person at a time.

* **Justification**
    * Purpose of exporting is to export one's details and send to their friends instead of exporting multiple persons' details 
    * Exporting multiple persons' details increase the length of the command which leads to more error 

**Aspect: Exporting all details**
* **Alternative 1:** Export all details of a `Person`.
    * Pros:
        * Users can export all details of a `Person` including `Groups` and `Tags`
        * Easier to implement
    * Cons:
        * Exporting groups and tags is not used in import

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Export all details of a `Person` except `Group` and `Tag`
    * Pros:
        * Less bug prone as lesser details are exported.
        * Do not have to recreate a new UniqueGroupList for exported `Person`.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement

* **Justification**
    * As import does not import `Group` and `Tag`. Exporting all details of a `Person` is not required.
    * Different users may have different `Tag` or `Group` for their contact. Hence `Group` and `Tag` is not exported/imported.

### \[Developed\] Import

The export feature allows users to import a person's details to a json file. Groups and tags are not imported.

This is implemented using the `ImportCommand`, `JsonImporter`.

The `ImportCommand` uses a `JsonImporter` to import data from the file `data/export.json`

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an export command:

<img src="images/ImportCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="500" />

#### Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute API call when a `Person` is being updated:

<img src="images/ImportCommandSequenceDiagramSetPerson.png" width="1000" />

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to
   parse the user command.
2. If the user command has the import `COMMAND_WORD`, the `AddressBookParser` creates a `ImportCommand`.
4. The `ImportCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `ImportCommand` instance which obtains the data from the file (as a `ReadonlyAddressBook`) via the `Importer` API call
6. A `Person` is then created via the `createImportPerson()` call
7. The `Person` is set in the `Model`
8. Execution of `ImportCommand` results in a `CommandResult` created and returned back to the `LogicManager`, completing the execution.

In the event that a new person is added due to the import:
<img src="images/ImportCommandSequenceDiagramAddPerson.png" width="1000" />

1. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the user's command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` class to
   parse the user command.
2. If the user command has the import `COMMAND_WORD`, the `AddressBookParser` creates a `ImportCommand`.
4. The `ImportCommand` instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`
5. The `LogicManager` then executes the `ImportCommand` instance which obtains the data from the file (as a `ReadonlyAddressBook`) via the `Importer` API call
6. A new `Person` is then created via the `createNewImportPerson()` call
7. The `Person` is added to the `Model`
8. Execution of `ImportCommand` results in a `CommandResult` created and returned back to the `LogicManager`, completing the execution.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: Importing multiple persons**
* **Alternative 1:** Import multiple `Person` in one user command.
    * Pros:
        * Users can import multiple persons at once instead of importing each person one at a time.
    * Cons:
        * More bug-prone as unable to verify the source of import files, import files could possibly be corrupted.

* **[Current implementation] Alternative 2:** Only allow one person to be imported in one user command.
    * Pros:
        * Easy to implement.
        * Less bug-prone as import files are less likely to be from external sources.
    * Cons:
        * Users have to export one person at a time.

* **Justification**
    * Importing is meant to be paired with exports. Ensuring that files that are imported are likley to be valid exports will reduce issues and bugs during importing.
    * Import command can be easily modified to accept larger export files in future iterations.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature


#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has a need to keep track of events happening in their life
* has to manage different projects
* needs a way view their friend's free time
* wants to organise their contacts into groups
* needs a method which is able to compile every group member's FTS

**Value proposition**:

* Helps users to keep track of personal and friends timetable
* Students find it hard to find FTS within their group of friends in NUS as they have to compare their
timetables one by one. WGT then helps students to easily find FTS within their friend groups
* Students can keep track of group meetings across all modules

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Group name case-sensitive
* Feature flaw: Users can add groups containing the same letters/numbers but different capitalisation. For example 'CS2103' and 'cs2103' are two different groups
* Future plan: As we are planning to integrate with NUSMODS in the future. All groups would follow the same naming convention as NUS modules where they are capitalised. So we plan to make all group names capitalised in the future.

### Data file editable
* Feature flaw: Users are able to edit the addressbook.json in the data folder. This can cause unwanted errors. We have handled json files with invalid parameters but it wipes out all existing content in the file if its invalid.
* Future plan: We plan to encrypt the json file using methods such as XOR encryption which makes the json file non-human readable. This prevents users from intentionally editing certain parameters.

### Event names
* Feature flaw: Exporting a person includes the exact names for all events. This is undesirable for users as they may only want to share which date and time they are unavaliable and not share what event they have.
* Future plan: We plan to only export date and time of an event while the event name would be a fixed name. (e.g Events).

### Recurring Event Time
* Feature flaw: Users cannot add a recurring event that last the whole day due to hourly basis implementation. ie: from today 00:00 to tomorrow 23:59
* Feature plan: We plan to allow users to enter recurring events that spans over more than one day to solve so that it will be more flexible.
