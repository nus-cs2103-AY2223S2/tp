### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The \* \* _Architecture Diagram_ \* \* given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, 
`DepartmentListPanel`, `LeaveListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from 
the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

As the `Logic` component executes user commands, the `UI` component,

- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- relies on stored data in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee`, `Department` or `Leave` object residing 
  in the `Model`.

### 3.3. Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](./images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SudoHRParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an employee).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `SudoHRParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SudoHRParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4. Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](./images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the system data i.e., all `Employee`, `Department` and `Leave` objects (which are contained in `UniqueEmployeeList`, `UniqueDepartmentList` and `UniqueLeaveList` objects respectively).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Employee`, `Department` and `Leave` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>`, `ObservableList<Department>` or `ObservableList<Leave>`, that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### 3.5. Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](./images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both SudoHR data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `SudoHRStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.SudoHR.commons` package.

## 4. **Design & Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details, alongside considerations and constraints, on how certain features or classes are implemented.


### 4.1. Design considerations:

#### 4.1.1. Employee
An important design consideration to note for Employee is the multiple different fields that qualify as _keys_, such as an employee id, email address, and phone number.

These are fields to guard against duplication. An employee's id is any uniquely generated identifier assigned to it by the company upon joining. Two employees should not share email field or phone number as those two fields are understood to be unique.

Since any employee can be identified by its id, and it makes semantic sense, we have decided on the id field as the _Primary Key_. This field can be used by internal operations without any concern of duplicates and allow us to easily retrieve and display the unique employee with the given id.

Under this design, SudoHR supports having several employees with the same name fields, without running the risk of retrieving or using the wrong employee's data.

##### Cascading employee updates and deletion to department and leave
An important functionality is to ensure updates to employee is cascaded down to department-level and leave-level because
each department and leave has its own list of employees. This issue becomes more prominent during loading of storage files
where employee objects are separately created for department's and leave's employee lists.
Hence, any editing of an employee's fields after SudoHR is initialized from storage needs to be cascaded down to leaves and departments to modify the equivalent employee object.

Further, we need to ensure the UI correctly refreshes for any changes made to an employee.
For instance, if an employee has been deleted, he/she should be removed from their department and the department count should drop. The same can be said for leaves.
This consistency is crucial to avoid confusing the user, especially since several of our commands are intertwined.

#### 4.1.2. Departments

An important design consideration for Department is that it must not contain duplicate employees. This is to ensure simplicity and
clarity when adding and removing employees from a department, as well as for the cascading process.

Each department is uniquely identified by its name, as a department should not share the same name with another department.

In the future, it would be possible to add more fields to a department, such as manager, parent department, etc.

#### 4.1.3. Leaves

An important design consideration for Leave is that it must not contain duplicate employees. This is to ensure simplicity and
clarity when adding and removing employees from a Leave object, as well as for the cascading process.

Each leave is uniquely identified by its LeaveDate which represent the date on which the leave is on and tracks all
the employees that have taken leave on that specific day. We tracked all the leaves using the UniqueLeaveList which
follows a similar implementation as UniqueEmployeeList except that it enforces the constraints that each Leave's
LeaveDate must be unique.

In the future, it would be possible to modify SudoHR to track different types of leaves
(eg. Medical) by adding a new type field to the Leave class.

### 4.2. Employee-related features

![EmployeeModelClassDiagram](./images/commands/employee/EmployeeModelClassDiagram.png)

The 'Employee' object represents an Employee in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueEmployeeList`.

The attributes of an Employee are:
- `Id`: The employee id, which is their unique identifier in the company.
- `Name`: The name of the employee.
- `Email`: The email of the employee, which should be unique.
- `Phone`: The phone of the employee, which should be unique.
- `Address`: The address of the employee.
- `Tags`: The tags assigned to the employee.

**Note**:
1. For the commands in this section, the order in which the prefixes (if any) are placed does not matter.
   1. `edit eid/37 a/ntu p/8461 4872` will return the same result as `edit eid/37 p/8461 4872 a/ntu`
2. If duplicated prefixes are provided, only the argument associated with last instance of the same prefix will be processed by the parser.
3. We make a distinction between the prefixes `id/` and `eid/`. The former is used in commands during adding of an employee or editing of an employeeâ€™s Id field whereas the latter is used in commands that references an employee that exists in SudoHR.


#### 4.2.1 Adding an employee

The `add` command adds a new employee, with the specified fields, into SudoHR. Note that only the 'Tag' field is optional.

Activity Diagram:
![AddEmployeeCommand](./images/commands/employee/AddEmployeeActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:
![AddEmployeeCommand](./images/commands/employee/AddEmployeeSequenceDiagram.png)


##### Flow
1. The user enters the command, eg. `add id/37 n/John p/9861 7251 e/John@nus.com a/nus t/Vegetarian`
2. The parser will parse the argument and instantiates several fields: Id, name, phone, email, address, and tags, respectively with the prefixes.
3. An `Employee` object is constructed and handed over to the `AddCommand`.
4. The command is executed. It first checks if there exists an employee with the same Id field as specified, followed by phone number, and lastly email address.
5. If none of the fields are duplicated, the model adds the employee to SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations
When checking for duplicated fields across employees, the `Id`, `Phone`, and `Email` fields are checked.
This is because `Id` is meant to be the unique identifier for an employee and `Phone` and `Email` fields are understood
to be unique fields as well.

The Id field is an integer. To avoid ambiguity in interpretation and possible confusion in identifying an employee, we have decided to ignore preceding zeros. 
For instance, `0007` and `7` are treated as one and the same.

#### 4.2.2 Editing an employee

The `edit` command edits the fields of an existing employee in SudoHR. 
Note that it is mandatory to specify the Id of the employee to be edited and at least one of the fields must be changed.

Activity Diagram:
![EditEmployeeCommand](./images/commands/employee/EditEmployeeActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:
![EditEmployeeCommand](./images/commands/employee/EditEmployeeSequenceDiagram.png)


##### Flow
1. The user enters the command, eg. `edit eid/37 p/8461 4872 a/ntu`. The employee with Id 37 will be identified and will have its phone and address fields updated as specified, if it exists in SudoHR.
2. The parser will instantiate a new `Phone` and `Address` object constructed from the arguments associated with `/p` and `/n`, which represents the new phone number and address fields respectively.
3. A `EditEmployeeDescriptor` object is constructed with the updated fields and alongside the employee's Id, are handed over to `EditCommand`.
4. The command is executed. It first verifies that there is an employee with Id 37. 
5. If such an employee exists, the command will then check if any of the 3 identities fields - Id, phone number, and email - have duplicated instances between the proposed changes and employees in SudoHR.
   The non-edited attributes of the employee will remain unaffected and inherited by the `EditEmployeeDescriptor`
6. If uniqueness in the 3 identities fields can be maintained, the old employee instance will be replaced with the new employee instance created by `EditEmployeeDescriptor`.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations
The `EditEmployeeDescriptor` is used to store the details to be edited. This abstraction is used as not all fields
may be edited for the `EditCommand`. So, this class ensures that fields are not edited will be unaffected and correctly initialized for the new edited employee. 
This modularity in design will prove useful in the future if more employee-level details are added, as per the open-closed principle.

It is important to check and guard against duplication of Id, email, and phone fields during editing of an employee's fields.

While Id is the unique identifier of an employee, there should also be the flexibility of editing Id field without causing any subsequent inconsistency when referencing an employee.


#### 4.2.3 Deleting an employee
The `del` command deletes an existing employee from SudoHR.

Activity Diagram:
![DeleteEmployeeCommand](./images/commands/employee/DeleteEmployeeActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:
![DeleteEmployeeCommand](./images/commands/employee/DeleteEmployeeSequenceDiagram.png)


##### Flow
1. The user enters the command, eg. `del eid/37` where employee with Id 37 is to be removed from SudoHR.
2. The parser will instantiate the corresponding `Id` object constructed from the argument associated with the prefix `eid/`.
3. The command is executed. It first verifies that an employee with the specified Id exists.
4. If the employee exists, it is deleted from SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

#### Feature considerations
We need to ensure that if an employee is deleted, it is also removed from being tracked by other entities such as `Department` and `Leave`. More details are explained [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#cascading-employee-updates-and-deletion-to-department-and-leave).

#### 4.2.4 Listing all employees
The `list` command lists all the employees in SudoHR.

The call stack is the same as a typical command except that it has no specified parser. 
Instead, `SudoHrParser` directly returns the command containing the predicate `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EMPLOYEES` specified in the `Model` class.

Upon execution, it updates the `filteredEmployeeList` in SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.


#### 4.2.5 Finding an employee by ID
The `feid` command finds and displays an employee with the specified Id in SudoHR.

#### Flow
1. The user enters the command, eg. `feid eid/37` where employee with Id 37 is to be found.
2. The parser will instantiate the corresponding `Id` object constructed from the argument associated with the prefix `eid/`.
3. A predicate checking for the specified Id is instantiated and the command is executed with the predicate.
4. It first verifies that an employee with the specified Id exists.
5. If the employee exists, the `filteredEmployeeList` is updated to only contain the employee with Id of 37 and the UI will display only the employee.


#### 4.2.6 Finding an employee by keyword
The `find` command finds and displays all employees in SudoHR with some part of their names matching the specified keyword.

#### Flow
1. The user enters the command, eg. `find alex` to look for employees whose name contains 'alex'.
2. The parser will instantiate a predicate that looks for the specified keyword, constructed from the argument provided, in employee's name field.
3. The command is executed with the predicate and the `filteredEmployeeList` is updated to contain all of such employees, with the UI displaying the employees to the user.


### 4.3. Department-related features

![DepartmentModelClassDiagram](./images/commands/department/DepartmentModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Department` object represents a department in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueDepartmentList` managed by SudoHR.

The attributes of a department are:

- `DepartmentName`: The name of the department, which is also the unique identifier for a department.
- `UniqueEmployeeList`: The employees in a department, the list must not contain duplicate employees.

The uniqueness of each department in `UniqueDepartmentList` is enforced by checking against the `DepartmentName`. This will be explained in the _Adding a department_ section.

**Note**
1. For the commands in this section, the order in which the prefixes (if any) are placed does not matter.
2. If duplicated prefixes are provided, only the argument associated with last instance of the same prefix will be processed by the parser.

#### 4.3.1. Adding a department

The `adep` command adds a new `Department` in SudoHr.

Activity Diagram:

![AddDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `adep n/Sales`
2. The parser will instantiate a new `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of the argument `/n` which represents the department name.
3. A `Department` object is constructed from the `DepartmentName` and handed over to the `AddDepartmentCommand`.
4. The command is executed. It first checks if the department contains the employee being added. This is done to prevent the addition of duplicate
   employees in the same department.
5. If there is no duplicate, the model adds the department to SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations

When checking for duplicates in the `UniqueDepartmentList`, the `DepartmentName` of the department is used to uniquely
identify each department. This is because it is illogical to have 2 departments with the same name, as the application
is meant for use by a single company.

If duplicate arguments are present in the same command, the last instance of the duplicated argument is taken in by the parser.

#### 4.3.2. Editing a department

The `edep` command edits the department-level details of an existing `Department` in SudoHr. Currently, you can only
edit the department name field as it is the only existing department-level detail.

Activity Diagram:

![EditDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/EditDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![EditDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/EditDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `edep Marketing n/Sales`. Marketing is the new department name and Sales is the old department name.
2. The parser will instantiate a new `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of the argument `/n` which represents the new department name.
3. A `EditDepartmentDescriptor` object is constructed from the `DepartmentName` and handed over to the `EditDepartmentCommand`.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the department called Marketing.
5. If the Marketing department exists, the command will then create the new department called Sales using the EditDepartmentDescriptor.
   The non-edited attributes from Marketing will be passed down to Sales.
6. The command then checks if the edited department exists in SudoHR.
7. If there is no duplicate, the model adds the department to SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations

The `EditDepartmentDescriptor` is used to store the details to be edited. This abstraction is used as not all fields
may be edited for the `EditDepartmentCommand`, hence we use this class to figure out what to pass down during the
construction of the new edited department. As of now, this class may be trivial but will prove more useful in the future
when more department-level details are added (e.g. creation date, director, work type, etc.).

It is also important to check if the name of the newly edited department clashes with any existing departments in
SudoHR, as the name is the unique identifier for a department.

#### 4.3.3. Deleting a department

The `deldep` command deletes an existing `Department` in SudoHR.

Activity Diagram:

![DeleteDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/DeleteDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![DeleteDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/DeleteDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `deldep n/Sales`. Sales is the department to be deleted.
2. The parser will instantiate a new `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of the argument `/n` which represents the new department name.
3. The `DepartmentName` is passed down to the command.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the department called Sales.
5. If the Sales department exists, it will be deleted from SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

#### 4.3.4. Adding an employee to a department

The `aetd` command adds an existing `Employee` to an existing `Department` in SudoHR.

Activity Diagram:

![AddEmployeeToDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddEmployeeToDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddEmployeeToDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddEmployeeToDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `aetd eid/100 n/Software Engineering`. It represents that the employee with ID 100
   is supposed to be added to the Software Engineering department.
2. The parser instantiates a new `Id` and `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of arguments `eid/` and `n/` respectively.
3. The command is executed. It first tries to find the employee with ID 100 and department called Software Engineering.
4. If the employee and department exists, the command checks if the same employee exists in the department.
5. If there is no duplicate employee in the department, the model adds the employee to the department.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations

There was a major design decision, which is to use `UniqueEmployeeList` for the employee list inside a `Department`.
The idea is that a department should not contain duplicate employees. Hence, we made use of the existing
`UniqueEmployeeList` class in `SudoHr`, instead of creating a new employee list class for Department. This logic is
reused in `Leaves` as well.

It should be noted that we still used defensive checks such as `department.hasEmployee` despite the
`UniqueEmployeeList` having such checks internally already.

#### 4.3.5. Removing an employee from a department

The `refd` command removes an `Employee` from an existing `Department` in SudoHR.

Activity Diagram:

![RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `refd eid/100 n/Software Engineering`. It represents that the employee with ID 100
   is supposed to be removed from the Software Engineering department.
2. The parser instantiates a new `Id` and `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of arguments `eid/` and `n/` respectively.
3. The command is executed. It first tries to find the employee with ID 100 and department called Software Engineering.
4. If the employee and department exists, the command checks if the same employee exists in the department.
5. If the employee exists in the department, the model removes the employee from the department.

After that, the command result is returned.

#### 4.3.6. Listing an employee's departments

The `led` command

Activity Diagram:

![ListEmployeeDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/ListEmployeeDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![ListEmployeeDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/ListEmployeeDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `led eid/100`. It represents listing all departments that contain employee
   with ID 100.
2. The parser instantiates a new `Id` object constructed from the input of argument `eid/`.
3. The `Id` object is used to instantiate the `DepartmentContainsEmployeePredicate`, which will be used to filter
   the `FilteredDepartmentList` later on.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the employee with ID 100.
5. If the employee exists, the `FilteredDepartmentList` will be updated and SudoHR will display all the departments
   that employee with ID 100 is in.

After that, the command result is returned.

#### 4.3.7. Listing department headcount

The `ldhc command`

Activity Diagram:

![ListDepartmentHeadcountCommand](./images/commands/department/ListDepartmentHeadcountActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![ListDepartmentHeadcountCommand](./images/commands/department/ListDepartmentHeadcountSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow
1. The user enters the command, e.g. `ldhc d/2023-04-10 n/Human Resources` to list the department headcount for Human Resources department
on the given date of 2023 April 10.
2. The parser instantiates a new `DepartmentName` object constructed from the argument prefixed by `n/` and checks that the date prefixed by `d/` is valid.
3. `ListDepartmentHeadcountCommand` object is returned and when executed, it gets the department with the `DepartmentName` object created in step 2.
4. It creates a new `LeaveDate` object with the valid date prefixed by `d/` and gets a `Leave` associated with `LeaveDate` object.
5. `FilteredDepartmentList` is updated to show the department with `departmentName` and the `FilteredEmployeeList` is updated to reflect the employees that are not in the 
`Leave` object and in the `Department` object.


### 4.4. Leave-related features
The `Leave` object represents a leave date in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueLeaveList`.

![LeaveModelClassDiagram](./images/commands/leave/LeaveModelClassDiagram.png)


The attributes of a leave are:

- `LeaveDate`: The date of the leave, which is also the unique identifier for a leave
- `UniqueEmployeeList` : The employees who applied for this leave, the list must not contain duplicate employees. 

**Note**
1. For the commands in this section, the order in which the prefixes (if any) are placed does not matter.
2. If duplicated prefixes are provided, only the argument associated with last instance of the same prefix will be processed by the parser.

#### 4.4.1. Adding an employee's leave
The `aetl` command adds an employee's leave on a specific day:

Activity Diagram:

![AddEmployeeToLeaveCommand Activity Diagram](.//images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddEmployeeToLeaveCommand Sequence Diagram](./images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeave.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command `aetl eid/1 d/2022-03-04` where 1 is the employee id and 2022-03-04 is the leave date.
2. The parser instantiates a new `Id` and `LeaveDate` object constructed from the input of argument `eid/` and `d/` respectively
3. The `Id` and `LeaveDate` are passed down to the command.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the `Employee` with ID 1 and the `Leave` that represents the date on which the leave is taken. If the `Leave` does not exist, a new one is created and added to `SudoHR`. If the `Employee` does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
5. If the employee already exists in `Leave`, an error message will be displayed.
6. Assuming if Step 5 completes without exception, the employee would be added to the `Leave`.
7. `FilteredEmployeeList` will be updated to only display all employees having leave on the input date.
8. `FilteredLeaveList` will be updated to only display the leave on the added date.

##### Feature considerations

We decided to throw an exception when the employee has already taken leave on the same day as the input date, since the user may have accidently provided a wrong date and hence the exception would be more suitable as it would be more noticeable than the success message.


#### 4.4.2. Deleting an employee's leave
The `defl` command delete an employee's leave on a specific day:

Sequence Diagram:

![RemoveEmployeeFromLeaveCommand Sequence Diagram](./images/commands/leave/DeleteEmployeeFromLeave.png)

##### Flow

1. The user types and enters the command `defl eid/1 d/2022-03-04` where 1 is the employee id and 2022-03-04 is the leave date.
2. The parser would instantiate a new `Id` and `LeaveDate` constructed from the input of argument `eid/` and `d/` respectively
3. The `Id` and `LeaveDate` are passed down to the newly created command.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the `Employee` with ID 1 and the `Leave` that represents the date on which the leave is taken. If the `Employee` does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
5. If the employee does not exists in `Leave` (The employee has yet take leave on the input date), an error will be thrown too.
6. Assuming if Step 5 completes without exception, the employee would be added to the `Leave`.
7. `FilteredEmployeeList` will be updated to only display all employees having leave on the input date.
8. `FilteredLeaveList` will be updated to only display the leave on the delete date.


#### 4.4.3. Adding an employee's leave in a range
The `aelr` command adds an employee's leave on all the days between the range of a start date to an end date inclusive.

Activity Diagram:

![AddEmployeeLeaveFromTo Activity Diagram](./images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddEmployeeLeaveFromTo Sequence Diagram](./images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeaveFromTo.png)

##### Flow

1. The user types and enters the command `aelr eid/1 s/2022-03-04 e/2022-03-06` where 1 is the employee id, 2022-03-04 is the start date and 2022-03-06 is the end date.
2. The parser checks that the end date `e/` is not before the start date represented by `s/`.The end date `e/` also must be less than 7 days away from the start date `s/`. If both conditions are not satisfied, an error message will be shown.
3. The parser would instantiate a `Id` constructed from the input of argument `eid/` and a list of `LeaveDate` objects representing every single day in the range between `s/` and `e/` with the end and start dates inclusive.
4. The `Id` and list of `LeaveDate` are passed down to the newly created command.
5. The command is executed. The command first tries to find the `Employee` with ID 1. If the `Employee` does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
6. The command then checks if the employee has taken leave on any of the days in the range between the start date `s/` and end date `e/` inclusive. If this is the case, an error message would be thrown.
7. Assuming step 6 completes with no exception, `Employee` is added to `Leave` on all the days in the range of the start day to end date inclusive
8. `FilteredLeaveList` will be updated to show all the days on which the employee has successfully taken leave.

##### Feature considerations
We intentionally limited the range of days to be added to 1 week. This is to avoid excessively large ranges that are likely to be an error or typo rather than intended, such as taking leaves over multiple years. Hence, we decided that 1 week would be the most appropriate duration as it is the typical length of leave taken when people go on vacation.

Should an employee indeed have more than 1 week of leave applied, the leave will be registered as different commands.

We also decided to guard against adding the range of leaves dates if even one of the days have already been indicated as leave. This is to be consistent with AddEmployeeToLeave command. In the case that the user would actually like to extend the leave for an employee, the addition would only require two additional commands and hence, is likely of minimal inconvenience to the user.

#### 4.4.4. Listing all employees taking leave on a specific day

The `leol` command lists employees taking leave on a specific date.

##### Flow 
1. The user types and enters the command `leol 2022-04-02` where 2022-04-02 is the date input provided.
2. The parser would instantiate a `LeaveDate` object constructed from the input argument.
3. The command is executed. It instantiates a new `LeaveContainsEmployeePredicate` that will filter out employees that have not taken leaves on the specified date.
4. The command uses the `LeaveContainsEmployeePredicate` to filter the employees and display the employees that have taken leave on the specified day.


#### 4.4.5. Listing all leaves 
The `llve` command lists all leaves taken by employees in SudoHR.

The call stack is the same as a typical command except that it has no specified parser.
Instead, `SudoHrParser` directly returns the command containing the predicate `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_NON_EMPTY_LEAVES` specified in the `Model` class.

Upon execution, it updates the `filteredLeaveList` in SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations
Only leaves that have at least 1 employee will be displayed.

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

When there are violation of constraints in the data files, SudoHR will not start. The specific error will be logged
in the system output.

## 8. **Planned Enhancements**

Here are a list of fixes we plan to add in the near future to counter known feature flaws.

### 8.1. Department name constraints

* Department name will be case-insensitive as case sensitivity does not create ambiguity between department names.
For example, 'Marketing' and 'marketing' are clearly the same department.

* Department names will also allow special characters such as '(', ')' and ',' to account for department names with
labels. For example, 'Sales, Singapore' can be a valid department name.

### 8.2. Employee name field constraints
* `Employee` name field will also allow special characters such as '/', which are often used as an abbreviation in 's/o', in subsequent iterations.

### 8.3. Employee phone field constraints
* Currently, the phone field is restrictive in that it only accepts 8-digit phone numbers for an employee's phone field. While registered local numbers will not face any issues, registered numbers outside of Singapore likely will if they do not adhere to 8-digits. 
We understand this is far from ideal, since it is perfectly reasonable for businesses to hire foreign talents who may not have a locally registered number. Hence, subsequent iterations will improve the parsing of phone fields to account for foreign phone numbers that are not necessarily 8 digits.

### 8.4. Employee email field constraints
* Currently, SudoHR treats email addresses as case-sensitive which we acknowledge shouldn't be as it fails to reflect real world behavior as well. We plan to ensure email addresses are case-insensitive in subsequent iterations.
Under which, `JOHN@NUS.COM` and `john@nus.com` will be treated as one and the same.

### 8.5. Filtering of employee window when searching details for a specific employee
* Employee window should be filtered to a specific employee when viewing that employee's details. For example, the `led` lists
all the departments the employee is in. It would also be more intuitive to display that single employee in the employee window
as well after invoking the command, so that the user will know which employee's departments is being displayed in the department
window if he forgets.

### 8.6. Filtering of department window when searching details for a specific department
* Department window should be filtered to a specific department when viewing that department's details. For example, the `leid` lists
all the employees in the specific department. It would also be more intuitive to display that single department in the department window
as well after invoking the command, so that the user will know which department's employees is being displayed in the employee
window if he forgets.

### 8.7. Filtering of leave window when searching details for a specific leave date
* Leave window should be filtered to a specific leaved ate when viewing that leave date's details. For example, the `leol` lists
all the employees taking leave on a specific day. It would also be more intuitive to display that single leave date in the leave window
as well after invoking the command, so that the user will know for which date the employees filtered in the employee list are taking
leave on.
