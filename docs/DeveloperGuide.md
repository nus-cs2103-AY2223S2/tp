### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletec 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Customer` and `Order` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletec 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletec 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component stores:

* the unique list of all `Customer` and `Order` objects in a `UniqueCustomerList` and `UniqueOrderList`.

* the current filtered list of `Customer` and `Order` objects as separate `FilteredList<Customer>` and `FilteredList<Order>` objects, which uses the unique lists as their source.

* the current sorted list of `Customer` and `Order` objects as separate `SortedList<Customer>` and `SortedList<Order>` objects, which uses the filtered lists as their source.

  These are exposed to the outside as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>` and `ObservableList<Order>` objects that can be 'observed'
  
  e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* the current 'displayed' `Customer` or `Order` object.

* the list of `Order` objects associated with the current 'displayed' `Customer` as a separate `FilteredList<Order>`

  This is exposed to the outside as an `ObservableList<Order>` object.

* a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.

  This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `Model` does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.loyaltylift.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[//]: # (@@author Junyi00)

### Bookmark Customer 

The commands `markc` and `unmarkc` are responsible for bookmarking or un-bookmarking a customer respectively. 
Parsing of the user input is done by the `LogicManager` and `AddressBookParser` (as explained in the section of [Logic component](#logic-component)).

Using the `markc` command as an example, the parsing process will create a `MarkCustomerCommand` object.
The `MarkCustomerCommand` is then executed, and its process is described in the following sequence diagram.

![Sequence diagram for bookmarking a customer](images/MarkCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)
 
1. The list of filtered customers is retrieved from the `Model`, and the index is used to find the customer that needs to be bookmarked.
2. A new `Customer` object is created with it's `Marked` attribute to reflect that it is bookmarked.
3. `Model` is called again to replace the original customer to the newly created customer.

The sequence for the `unmarkc` command is similar as the above.

### Future Enhancements

Instead of using commands to manipulate the bookmark-ed status of a customer, LoyaltyLift can allow users to use the mouse to select the bookmark icon to swap between bookmarked and not bookmarked.
As we wanted to ensure that LoyaltyLift is optimised as a CLI application, we prioritised the implementation of `markc` and `unmarkc` over the ability to select on the graphical user interface.
However, certain users may find it more convenient to select the icon or prefer the flexibility of doing both depending on the situation.

### Add/Deduct reward points feature

A new feature of adding and deducting points for a customer was required.
A cumulative points system also had to be introduced. Adding points should increase the cumulative points, while deducting points should not affect the cumulative points of the customer.

As a result, a new attribute `cumulative` was introduced to `Points`.
For the parsing of the `addpoints` command, we considered multiple design choices.
The one we ultimately settled on was simply utilising the `Integer.valueOf()` method to parse the points inputted by the user.
Also, in the execution of `AddPointsCommand` class, the points to add would exist as an `Integer` object instead of a `Points` object. The addition or subtraction of points from the `Points` class would then be as simple as adding the
points to current points and cumulative points when it is positive, and subtracting from current points when it is negative.
This straightforward design would be sufficient to achieve the intended feature.
Lastly, to store the cumulative points of `Customer`, a new attribute `cumulativePoints` was introduced to `JsonAdaptedCustomer`.

#### Alternative approaches

There were other designs we were considering, listed below.

1. A design choice we had to make was for the implementation of the `addpoints` command.

   Originally, we intended for the command to include a modifier syntax for the user to specify if he or she wishes to add or subtract points from the customer.
   For instance, the command could be `addpoints 1 mod/- pt/100` to indicate that the user wants to subtract 100 points from the customer in the first index. This implementation would be more consistent with the other commands that follow the syntax of `[PREFIX]/` for the user to specify their command.

   However, we subsequently decided that this may be inconvenient for the user, and since it is more intuitive for the user to input 100 or -100 points, we decided to implement the command such that the modifier comes after the prefix `pt/`

2. We also considered creating a static inner class `AddPoints` in `Points`.

   This inner class will encapsulate the addition or subtraction of points.
   Consequently, the `AddPointsCommand` would take in an instance of `Points.AddPoints` as an attribute. This would allow an enum `modifier` to exist within the `AddPoints` inner class, allowing future extension of editing reward points by simply including a new enumeration of modifier.

   This would also allow a validity check of the points to be added or deducted. However, we later decided that this may not be necessary as checking the validity of the resultant `Points` after adding or subtracting is sufficient. Moreover, utilising the `Integer.valueOf` method in `AddPointsCommandParser` would make parsing much simpler as compared to evaluating the enum modifier that would come before points.

   This simpler design would also be sufficient as we had no plans to incorporate features other than the addition or subtraction of points.

### Customer and Order Notes

#### Implementation

A **note** is any string that is associated with a `Customer` or an `Order`.

To implement this, a new `note` field of type `Note` has been added to `Customer` and `Order`.

* `Note` is a class with a `String` field that can take any value except `null`.
* If a `Customer` or `Order` has a note, a **Note** section will be shown in their view panel
* An empty note is indicated by a blank string, in which case the **Note** section will not be shown.

There are four commands to manipulate a given customer/order's note

* `setnotec` to set or overwrite a `Customer`'s note
* `appendnotec` to add some string to the end of a `Customer`'s existing note
* `setnoteo` to set or overwrite an `Order`'s note
* `appendnoteo` to add some string to the end of an `Order`'s existing note

We settled on just a **set** and **append** command as deleting a note can be done by simply setting the note to an empty string. On the other hand, there is no clear way to edit text in a CLI application.

#### Potential Enhancements

* **Multiple Notes**

  Currently, a customer/order can have a single note. It may be useful if  they can have multiple notes instead. This would involve an alternative set of commands to add and remove notes for a given customer/order.

* **Note Tags**

  Different notes between different customers and orders may have related themes. Thus, the ability to add tags to these related notes can help the user group their notes.

  This could be done inline using a special character (e.g. `#`) within the note itself, where the system would automatically detect the tags.

  We can then provide an additional command to view all the notes with a specific tag, along with their associated customer/order.

### Sorting feature

Customers and Orders can be sorted by certain attributes. We decided to implement the sorting as a parameter for the list commands.

The sorting is done by adding a JavaFX `SortedList` to the `Model`, with the original `FilteredList` as its source. This `SortedList` is then used to display the customer and order list in place of the `FilteredList`.

The `SortedList` can be sorted by a `Comparator`.

* The `Comparator`s for each sorting option is provided as static constants by the `Customer` and `Order` class.
* To facilitate the comparators, the relevant attribute classes (e.g. `Name` and `Points`) will also implement the `Comparable` interface.

[//]: # (@@author Junyi00)

### Order Status

An order's `status` attribute represents the stage of an order, which can be one of these:
* Pending
* Paid
* Shipped
* Completed
* Cancelled

**Note:** Other than the `Cancelled` stage, an order is expected to start from `Pending` and proceed along the order as mentioned above.

For the implementation, we introduce a few classes.

1. Firstly, `StatusValue` is an enumeration whose values are the stages mentioned above.
1. Next, the `StatusUpdate` class encapsulates a `StatusValue` and a date.
1. Finally, a `Status` class serves as the attribute of an order that has multiple `StatusUpdate`.

A `StatusUpdate` encapsulates the date an `Order` transitions into a `StatusValue`.
Thus, an order's `Status` is associated with many `StatusUpdate` to represent the history of how an order progresses from one stage to another.

#### Alternative Approaches

We also considered implementing the status attribute as an array of dates with a size of 5. 
Each entry of this array would correspond to each possible stage of the order.

However, this design would not be extensible for including other information such as a note or comment for each stage.
Furthermore, this design assumes that the order's status can only move forward in progress and cannot revert without losing information.
E.g. An order may return from `Shipped` to `Paid` again if the shipping fails to succeed for the business owner.

With the current implemented approach, `StatusUpdate` can encapsulate other information such as a note or comment. 
Furthermore, the `Status` class has many `StatusUpdate` without assuming its size or any other information.
Hence, this potentially allows subsequent `StatusUpdate` to have a stage that is before the previous entry of `StatusUpdate`.
More details are explained in **Potential Enhancements**.


#### Potential Enhancements

* **Improvement in Reverting Order Progress**

  Currently, the implementation reverts an order's status by deleting the latest `StatusUpdate`. 
  Hence, information is lost that an order was once in that state before returning back.
  Furthermore, `Status` sorts `StatusUpdate` by its `StatusValue` so that the assumption that the latest entry is the latest is always true.

  In the future, it may be useful that this information be preserved and not deleted from the system. 
  A potential implementation is by appending new `StatusUpdate` into `Status` instead of deleting the latest entry.
  However, do note that the sorting logic must be updated.

* **More Status Information**

  In the future, the user may find it useful to provide additional information when updating an order's status.
  E.g. Add notes about the shipping details when the order updates from `Paid` to `Shipped`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be
initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

   ![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

2. The user executes `deletec 5` command to delete the 5th customer in the address book. The `deletec` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `deletec 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

   ![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

3. The user executes `addc n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new customer. The `addc` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

   ![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.
   </div>

4. The user now decides that adding the customer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

   ![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.
   </div>

   The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

   ![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

   </div>

   The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

   </div>

5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

   ![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addc n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

   ![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletec`, just save the customer being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

[//]: # (@@author Junyi00)

### Enabling Customers with Duplicate Names to be Created

#### Current Situation / Problem

It is a common occurrence for 2 customers to have the same full name. 
However, an attempt to create a 2nd customer with the same name will fail as the user will face an error.

The error occurs because LoyaltyLift does not allow 2 customers with the same name to exist. 
In [`Customer.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/loyaltylift/model/customer/Customer.java), `Customer::isSameCustomer` is responsible for determining if 2 customers have the same identity, and it returns true if they have the same name.

#### Possible Enhancements

Ideally, a customer can be uniquely identified by a government-issued identification number (e.g. NRIC for Singaporeans). 
However, this information is most likely unavailable to the small business owner; hence is not a feasible solution.

Therefore, we propose 3 possible tweaks or solutions.

1. **Use phone number to uniquely identify a customer**

   Instead of using the customer's name, their phone number is a better unique identifier. 
   With this solution, `Customer::isSameCustomer` will return true if 2 customers' phone numbers are equal. 
   
   **Pros**: There is a much lower probability of conflicts in the customer's phone number. One of the few possible occurrences is when a customer changes phone number, and another customer obtains that customer's previous phone number.

   **Cons**: However, a customer may not want to be contacted through phone but through email instead. Hence, the business owner will not be able to create a customer in this situation.

2. **Combining multiple attributes to uniquely identify a customer**

   Building upon the idea of using phone number as a unique identifier, we can instead use a combination of attributes as a unique identifier.
   Combining the customer's name, phone number and home address is possible. 
   With this combination, `Customer::isSameCustomer` will return true if 2 customers' names, phone numbers and home addresses are all equal.

   **Pros**: More robustly uniquely identify a customer in the absence of government-issued identification number.

   **Cons**: It is more error-prone as a customer's information, such as his phone number and address can change over time. More attributes must be updated compared to just using a single attribute as a unique identifier.

3. **Use a hidden identification number**

   Instead of using the customer's name, a customer can be uniquely identified with a hidden, randomly generated unique identifier.
   On creating every customer object, LoyaltyLift will allocate a new unique identifier number to the customer.
   `Customer::isSameCustomer` will return true if 2 customers' hidden unique identifier are the same.

   **Pros**: This tweak removes the dependency on the customer's personal information. Randomly generated unique identifier are quick to generate and have a very low chance of generating the same unique identifier.

   **Cons**: Duplicated customers may be created in the application. Without any dependency, this increases the possibility for a single real customer to exist as 2 customers in LoyaltyLift. If the business owner is not careful or is unaware that the customer already exists in LoyaltyLift, he may accidentally create the same customer again. With a unique identifier such as the phone number or customer's name, the user will face an error when adding a 2nd customer with the same personal information. This indicates that the business owner may be making a mistake because the customer already exists in LoyaltyLift. 

#### Extra Remarks

While the above solutions are mostly feasible, we can also explore the idea of giving the flexibility to the business owner to decide the unique identifier.
Using a phone number as the default unique identifier, most business owners may be satisfied and only face a few issues. This is because business owners can request that all customers share their phone numbers.

However, future implementations can allow the business owner to configure LoyaltyLift to use an email address or a combination of phone number and email address as the unique identifier instead. 
More experience users may wish for the freedom to configure this option or some users may require this feature to comply with regulations around sensitive customer data.

### Allow Customers to have similar Orders

Currently, a customer cannot have two orders with the same product name, quantity, and address on the same day.
This is because the orders will be considered as duplicates, as defined by `Order::isSameOrder`.

To improve this, we plan to assign a unique ID for each order such that two orders are considered duplicates if they have the same ID.

This ID can initially be randomly generated, but we then allow the user to define their own format as required by their business (e.g. some users may want to incorporate the order's created date into the identifier).

### Setting Tiers

Currently, the number of tiers in LoyaltyLift are hardcoded at three tiers. The names and points required for each tier are also cannot be customized. However, this can be inconvenient as users may have different point schemes.

To support this, we plan to add a `settier` command that allows the user to set each tier's name and required points by index.
For example, the customer may set the third tier to `Platinum` at 10,000 points by entering `settier 3 Platinum 10000`.

While each tier will have some default color, we can also consider including an option for the user to provide a hex code for their desired color, e.g. `settier 3 Platinum 10000 1affff`.

To complement this new command, we also plan to include a `viewtiers` command to display the existing tiers and a `deletetier` command to remove an existing tier.

### Access Orders made by a specific Customer

This enhancement consists of two parts:

* Accessing orders from a customer's order history
* Filtering the order list by customer name or index

#### Accessing orders from a customer's order history

Currently, the user can see a customer's list of orders by viewing the customer using the `viewc` command. However, there is no way to view each order in detail afterwards.

There are two approaches to make this possible:

1. Use the same list for the main order list and the customer view order list

   As described in the [_Model component_](#model-component) section, the order list of the displayed customer is a separate `FilteredList<Order>`. By using the same list as the main order list, we can use the `viewo` command to directly access the orders in the customer view.

1. Provide a separate command for viewing the orders displayed in the customer view

   This command may tentatively be called `viewco`, where it will specifically be used to access orders in the separate `FilteredList<Order>`.

#### Filtering the order list by customer name

Currently, the order list cannot be filtered to show only orders created by a specific customer. Moreover, the order list does not show the customer it's associated with. This can be inconvenient as multiple customers may make similar orders.

Thus, we plan to:

1. Update the UI of the order list to display each order's associated customer.

2. Enhance the `listo` command to support filtering by customer name.

   This can be implemented as a separate parameter `by/CUSTOMER_NAME` (e.g. `listo by/Alice`) where the keyword search logic would work in a similar manner as `findc` (case-insensitive, order-insensitive, full-word, `OR` search).
