## **Design**

### Architecture
<img src="images/DG-images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of MATHUTORING.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/DG-images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/DG-images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/DG-images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="350" />

More detailed Class diagram for Ui component:

<img src="images/DG-images/BetterUiClassDiagram.png" width="500" />

The UI consists of a MainWindow that is made up of different parts.
For instance, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `ScoreListPanel`,
`TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow`, `ImportWindow`, `ExportWindow` and `ExportProgressWindow` etc. All theses, including the MainWindow,
inherit from the abstract UiPart class which captures the commonalities between
classes that represent parts of visible GUI.

The UI component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI
parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view`
folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.

The UI component,
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be
updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the UI relies on the `Logic`
to execute the commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object
residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/DG-images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `MathutoringParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DG-images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/DG-images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `MathutoringParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `MathutoringParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/DG-images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the mathutoring data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Mathutoring`, which `Student` references. This allows `Mathutoring` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

</div>

<img src="images/DG-images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

#### Task model
**API** : [`Task.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java)

<img src="images/DG-images/TaskClassDiagram.png" width="400" />

* A `Student` has a `UniqueTaskList` object which holds all their `Task` objects.
* Each `Task` object has a `TaskStatus` assigned to it and can be any of `INPROGRESS`, `LATE` or `COMPLETE`.
* The `creationDate` will be hidden from the user and only be used for sorting the `UniqueTaskList`.
* The `UniqueTaskList` is sorted according to `TaskStatus`, and if two tasks have the same `TaskStatus`, they will be compared using their `creationDate`.

#### UniqueScoreList model
**API** : [`UniqueScoreList.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/score/UniqueScoreList.java)

<img src="images/DG-images/ScoreClassDiagram.png" width="400" />

* A `Student` has only one `UniqueScoreList` object which holds all their `Score` objects.
* `UniqueScoreList` is a separate filtered list with recent score at front which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable ObservableList<Student> that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* There is an inner class `ScoreSummary` inside `UniqueScoreList` class which holds the summary of recent five scores.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/DG-images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both mathutoring data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `MathutoringStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Private Math tuition teachers
* Has a need to manage a number of students' contacts and performance
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Tutors tend to use multiple applications to keep track of their student's contact details and performance. MATHUTORING comes into a centralised desktop application with a contact management system to track students' contact details and performance by keeping student contact details, tasks, and scores which subsequently allows the tutors to plan their lesson plan for future lessons and overall view of their schedule for ease of planning.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Tutors**: Private math tuition teachers that will be using the application
* **Students' progress**: For our current version, the progress of a student is tracked through
the number of tasks the student has completed
* **Students' performance**: For our current version, the performance of a student is tracked through a view
of the student's scores as well as a progress chart of the latest 5 scores.
* **Index**: The number of the item shown beside its name, on the list being referred to (e.g. "index of student" refers to the index number of the student (shown beside the student's name)
  in the student list shown in the application)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty level

This is the first time our team has worked on a Brownfield project where the AB3 codebase was the largest we have encountered in our careers. At the beginning, everyone was overwhelmed by the sudden increase in the number of classes compared to our previous projects, including our most recent project (referred to as "IP"). It took us quite a while to slowly digest the purpose of each class. Additionally, for most of us, this is one of the first projects where we have had to collaborate with team members using version control tools such as Github or SourceTree.

### Challenges faced

We faced several challenges when we were working on this application, the following are some examples and not limited to:

* As we lack experience in working with the pre-existing codebase, and AB3 is a relatively large project that we did not encounter before,
we had to take some time to learn from how AB3 works, such as how the user input is handled by AB3.
* Since we are relatively new to JavaFx, we also had to spend quite some time looking at the JavaFx library and learning how to use some
specific structures when designing the GUI.
* We also had to spend time searching CSS format in order to tweak the GUI to meet our requirements.
* Thinking how to design the structure of our application based on existing AB3 structure to make it follow Object-oriented programming.
* Making use of a new library to export PDF files.

### Effort required

As a result, the development of this application required a significant amount of effort due to the challenges mentioned above where we have to:

* Debugging and looking up on both Java and JavaFX documentations.
* Researching on the usage of the new library (PDFBox).
* Reading on guides such as tweaking the GUI to fulfil our requirements and an overall better user experience (Drag-and-Drop/CSS).

### Achievements

We were able to produce a complete application that fulfills our user requirements as well as overcame the challenges we have faced. With MATHUTORING, private Math tuition teachers can:

* Manage student contact details and track their performance with task and score records.
* View score charts and statistics to easily evaluate student progress.
* Generate PDF reports containing a student's tasks and scores for easy sharing.
* Export and import data to easily transfer to a new device.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Solutions proposed for known feature flaws

Listed are some feature flaws that were found in the current implementation of MATHUTORING. To improve the features of
future implementations, some solutions have been provided.

#### 1. Students with the same name are not allowed

The reason why we do not allow any student to have the same name is to avoid potential confusion. Although the user will
still be able to distinguish them by checking their personal information (e.g. their email, their address etc.), it would
be more straight forward to see a difference in name, i.e. Jason 1 and Jason 2. <br>
Nevertheless, we should consider to allow student to have the same name.

**Solution proposed:**

* Instead of not allowing students to have the same name, we do not allow any students to have both the same name and the
  same email.


#### 2. Numeric student names are allowed

Currently, student names can be numeric. i.e. student name can be "1". After some research we found out that most countries in the world do not allow for purely numeric name.

**Solution proposed:**

* Alter the behavior to only accept alphanumeric or alphabetic names
* Change the name regex to `[\\p{Alnum}]*[a-zA-Z][\\p{Alnum} ]*`


#### 3. Window does not reopen after it is minimized

After help/export/import window is minimized, clicking help/export/import on the top menu will not automatically show
the window again.

**Solution proposed:**

* Similarly to how ```getRoot().isShowing()``` is used to check if the window is shown, there is also a function called
```getRoot().isIconified()``` to check whether the window is minimised (returns ```true``` if minimised).
We can then return ```getRoot().setIconified(false)``` to restore the window to its previous state.


#### 4. Exams are not allowed to be on the same date

The aim of the score list is to keep track of a student's recent performance trend (especially the chart).
If the majority of the exams are conducted on the same date, it defeats our purpose of having the score records.<br>
However, it is a reasonable assumption that more than one exam is conducted on the same date.

**Solution proposed:**

* Allow at most five exams on the same date.


#### 5. Score table being cut after resizing the application window

This problem might happen after user resizes the application window, which can result in the horizontal scroll bar covering
part of the displayed score table.<br>
**Suggestion to be able to view the entire table:** Try to enlarge the window size, or click on the table and scroll up and down.

**Solution proposed:**

* Although the entire table should be able to be seen by the user after following the above suggestion, it may still hinder the user.
* The main reason the table is cut is due to the usage of JavaFX TableView. By default, it comes with a scrollbar and is relatively hard to customize.
* To resolve the feature flaw, JavaFX label will be used to construct the table with CSS instead of using the JavaFX TableView.


#### 6. Edit the tags will overwrite the whole list of tags

* Currently, if the user wants to add tags to students in the list, they can only use `edit` command and will need to input all existing tags along with the new tag.
* Also, if the user wants to edit a specific tag, they will also be required to input all existing tags along with the one they want to edit.
* There are currently no delete operations for tags.
* Without these operations, it is very hard to manage tags since the only way to do it is by using the `edit` command which is deteriorates the user experience.

**Solution proposed:**

* To solve this issue, at least two more commands can be created which are `addtag` and `deletetag`.
* With these new commands, the user will no longer be required to input the existing tags when adding a new tag.

#### 7. Inconsistency in score color in Score Chart and PDF file

There is an inconsistency for score color between score chart and PDF:
* Score chart:
  * Green color is used to indicate score values that are greater than or equal to 80.
  * Yellow color is used to indicate score values that are greater than or equal to 50.
  * Red color is used to indicate score values that are smaller than 50.
* PDF:
  * Green color is used to indicate score values of 100.
  * Yellow color is used to indicate score values that are smaller than 80.
  * Red color is used to indicate score values that are smaller than 50.

**Solution proposed:**

* To solve this issue, the criteria for the score color in the PDF file can be changed to follow the criteria of score color in the score chart.


#### 8. Change the tags of the sample data

Currently, the sample data contains tags, like `colleagues` and `friends`, that do not really fit the purpose of our application.

**Solution proposed:**

* To solve this issue, the tag can be changed to grade (primary, secondary, etc.) and gender.
