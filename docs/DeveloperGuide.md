### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/teambuilder/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/teambuilder/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/teambuilder/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/teambuilder/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/teambuilder/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
<a id="delete"/>
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/teambuilder/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram2.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the TeamBuilder data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Team` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTeamList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/teambuilder/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TeamBuilder data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `teambuilder.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add person feature

The add person feature allows for some fields to be optional. However, the person must have a name, and their name cannot be the same as another existing contact in TeamBuilder.

The interactions between components for the `add` command is similar to the `delete` command shown [above](#delete).

Below shows the activity diagram when the user inputs the add command in the command box:

![Activity Diagram for add person command](images/ActivityDiagram_AddPerson.png){:.center}

The _rake_ symbol in the `AddCommandParser parses input` actions is used to indicate that the action is describes in another subsidiary activity diagram. The activity diagram is as shown below: 

![Activity Diagram for add person parser](images/ActivityDiagram_AddCommandParser.png){:.center}

### Create team feature

The activity diagram when user inputs create command in the command box is similar to the Add person feature shown [above](#add-person-feature), with the difference being that Person objects are swapped with Team objects and error messages.

The same applies for CreateCommandParser, where the activity diagram is similar to AddCommandParser, with the difference being that the valid prefixes are now `tn/` and `td/` etc. The error messages are also catered towards Team creation, as opposed to Person creation.


### Optional Fields feature

The AB3 implementation made it such that you could not add a contact without having all of their fields present. We felt this to be not user-friendly as for our purposes it is unreasonable for users to have the phone, email, address, and major of the contact they which to add.

Thus, we have made it such that the only mandatory field is the persons name.

#### Implementation

The implementation for the follow fields: Phone, Email, Major, Address have been made optional. The implementation to achieve this is similar across these fields. We use the Phone class as an example.

```java
private static final Phone NO_PHONE = new Phone();

//...

private Phone() {
    value = "";
}
```

- The private constructor `Phone()` takes in no arguments and returns a phone instance where the value is an empty string.
- The private constructor is then used to create a static final `NO_PHONE` phone instance. This will be used as a placeholder when users does not input a phone field/ phone field is empty.


### Undo/Redo feature

#### Implementation

The `undo`/`redo` mechanism is based on the memento design pattern. Within the memento design pattern, there are three main classes:

1. `Originator` - The stateful object that becomes modified and requires to be restored using `undo`/`redo`.
2. `Memento` - The wrapper of a saved state of an `Originator` that is used to restore the `Originator`.
3. `Caretaker` - The aggregator of `Memento` that controls the sequence of `Memento`s for `undo`/`redo`.

The pattern can be implemented with the `Originator` and `Memento` as an <<interface>> to allow for better extension and reduce decoupling.

![Memento Design Pattern](images/MementoDesignPatternDiagram.png){:.center}


While the Memento Design Pattern is mostly used for `undo`, we can extend its functionality to include `redo`.

Implementing this design pattern results in the following:

- `Model` inferface extends the `Originator` interface, resulting in a concrete `Originator` in `ModelManger`.
- `TeamBuilderMemento` implements the `Memento` interface and acts as a saved state of `ModelManager`
- `HistoryUtil` replaces the `Caretaker` and tracks the timeline and order of `Memento`
- Any modifying `Command` will call `HistoryUtil#storePast` with `Model#save()` and their `COMMAND_WORD` or a description of what changed.\
(`AddCommand` is given as an example.)

![Implemented Memento Design](images/ImplementedMementoDesignDiagram.png){:.center}

As we want `undo`/`redo` to provide feedback to the user, the `Commands` must provide context to `HistoryUtil`


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.**
The user launches the application for the first time. The `HistoryUtil` will be initialized with two empty `Memento` arrays, one for `undo` and another for `redo`. The `currentNum`, an array index, will be `-1` indicating totally empty arrays.

![UndoRedoState0](images/NewUndoRedoState0.png){:.center}

**Step 2.**
The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the team builder. The `delete` command calls `Model#save()` before any actions, causing the initial state of the team builder to be saved as a `Memento`. The `delete` command provides the resutling `Memeto` and the context of the change (deleting 5) to `HistoryUtil#storePast`. The `Memento` is saved in `undoHistory` and the `currentNum`, the array index, increases to `0`.

![UndoRedoState1](images/NewUndoRedoState1.png){:.center}

**Step 3.**
The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#save()` before any actions, saving another `Memento`. The `Memento` and description (add n/david ...) is stored through `HistoryUtil#storePast`. The `Memento` is saved in `undoHistory` and the `currentNum` increases to `1`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/NewUndoRedoState2.png){:.center}

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info ">:information_source:**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#save()`, so the `Memento` is not stored in `HistoryUtil`.

</div>

**Step 4.**
The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `HistoryUtil#undo`.

`HistoryUtil#undo` will then operate as follows:
1. `Memento#getUpdatedMemo` is called on `undoHistory[currentNum]`, generating a `Memento` of the current state.
2. The resulting `Memento` is saved into `redoFuture[currentNum]`.
3. Then, `Memento#restore` is called on `undoHistory[currentNum]`
4. An `Optional<String> description` is returned

The `undo` command then feedbacks to the user that the undo has occured successfully along with a description if any.



![UndoRedoState3](images/NewUndoRedoState3.png){:.center}

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentNum` is at index -1, then there are no previous TeamBuilder states to restore. In this case, `HistoryUtil#undo` returns `Optional.empty()`.
As `undo` command uses `Optional::isPresent` to check if undo is successful, it will then return an error message to the user.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/NewUndoSequenceDiagram.png){:.center}

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `HistoryUtil#redo()`, which checks the `redoFuture` for any `Memento` to restore at `counterNum`. If present, the `Memento` is restored and a `Optional<String>` containing the description of the `Memento` is given to the `redo` command. The restored `Memento` is moved to `undoHistory` and removed from `redoFuture`. The `redo` command feedbacks the output to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `counterNum` is at an index where `redoFuture` is null, then there are no undone `Memento` to restore. The `redo` command uses the `Optional<String>` output `Optional::isPresent` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error message the user.

</div>

**Step 5.**
The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the TeamBuilder, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#Save()`, `HistroyUtil#storePast` , `HistroyUtil#undo`, `HistoryUtil#redo`. Thus, the `Model` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/NewUndoRedoState4.png){:.center}

**Step 6.**
The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#Save` and stores the resulting `Memento` and description (clear) into `HistoryUtil#storePast`. Since there is a new `Memento` for `undoHistory` that is not from `redoFuture`, all `Memento` in `redoFuture` are purged.

**Reason**: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/NewUndoRedoState5.png){:.center}

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img class="center" src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the state of the team builder found in ModelManager (Current choice).
  * Pros: Easy to implement, easy to extend, easy to modify what "state" is saved and restored.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage if state saved is too large.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
* **Alternative 3:** Save the entire team builder inside VersionedTeamBuilder, replacing TeamBuilder (Original AB-3 Choice)
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Difficult to extend. Performance issues in terms of memory usage. Undo/Redo timeline tied to TeamBuilder. No user feedback on what command was undone/redone.


### Sort feature

Both fields for sorting persons are compulsory, namely the order of sorting and the sort by criteria. The order and
sort by criteria that are available are listed in the User Guide.

Below shows the activity diagram when the user inputs the sort command in the command box:

![Activity Diagram for sort command](images/sortcommand-activity.png){:.center}

The subsidiary diagram, for SortCommandParser, is as shown below:

![Activity Diagram for sort command parser](images/newsortcommandparser.png){:.center}

#### Implementation

The `filteredPersons` variable in the ModelManager.java is defined by passing in the `getPersonList()` from `addressBook`
into a `FilteredList` object. However, `sortedPersons` variable in the ModelManager.java is instead defined by passing
in `filteredPersons` into a `SortedList` object.

This ensures that modifications (deletes/edits) to the persons after a `list` or `sort` command will be consistent.

#### Design considerations:

The `parse` function in SortCommandParser.java is used to trim and process the arguments before instantiating
SortCommand object. The `execute` function in SortCommand is used to identify the order and sort by to be used by the
comparator and to run the sort with the comparator. This ensures that subsequent additions to sort by, such as sort by
name etc, would only require to edit the `execute` function.

The `SortBy` Enum ensures that new sorting options can be extended in future iterations. A new switch case can be added
to the `SortCommand` to perform an `updateSort()` for the `Model` object, with the corresponding comparator.

### Show Team feature

The field for show team is compulsory. The current implementation requires user to input names of the targeted teams.

Below shows the activity diagram when the user inputs the show command in the command box:

![Activity Diagram for show command](images/ActivityDiagram_ShowCommand.png){:.center}

Below shows the activity diagram for the details of parsing show command:

![Activity Diagram for show command parser](images/ActivityDiagram_ShowCommandParser.png){:.center}

Below shows the activity diagram about the predicate processing of show command:

![Activity Diagram for show command parser](images/ActivityDiagram_TeamContainsKeywordsPredicate.png){:.center}

#### Implementation

Show command utilizes the `updateFilterPersonList()` method implemented in ModelManager.java to filter the
`filteredPersons` list variable in ModelManager with the given predicate `TeamContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

The `TeamContainsKeywordsPredicate` object takes in a `List<String>` from `ShowCommandParser`, and make use of the
`containsWordIgnoreCase()` from `StringUtil` to conduct matching between the user input and the `tagName` of each
the `teams` of each `Person` object.

#### Design considerations:

The `parse` function in ShowCommandParser.java will trim the arguments and create a predicate object with the input
after the command prefix. This predicate is passed to ShowCommand as a parameter. This ensured that this feature can
take other predicate in future iterations. Currently, there is only one predicate that search the keywords among team
names. When there are demands such as searching keywords among team requirements, new predicates can be created and
ShowCommand can easily adapt to new iterations.

TeamContainsKeywordsPredicate.java is created to facilitate the comparison between keywords and `tagName` of team.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**


### Adding and removing tags from persons
Currently, to add a Tag to a contact, one has to use the `edit` command to add a tag to the contact. There are main drawback is that the user has to input all the tags the person already has, as the `edit` command will remove all tags and only assign tags given in the command.

Similarly, to remove a Tag, the user has to use the `edit` command and type all the tags the person has and omit the ones that the user wishes to remove.

This is rather tedious for the user and negatively affects user experience.

#### Enhancement:
Allow users to add and remove tags specifically, users only need to input the tags they wish to add/remove.

#### Suggested implementation:
Create two commands, `add-tag` and `remove_tag` with the following input format:

```add_tag <PERSON_INDEX> t/<TAG_NAME> [t/<TAG_NAME> ...]```

```remove_tag <PERSON_INDEX> t/<TAG_NAME> [t/<TAG_NAME> ...]```

- `<PERSON_INDEX>` is the index of the person shown on the person list of the Ui. If there is no person at the given index, the command will throw an error. This field is required.
- `<TAG_NAME>` is the name of the tag the user wishes to add to a person. If the command is `remove_tag` and the tag is not found in the contact, an error will be thrown. This field is required.
- `[t/<TAG_NAME> ...]` is/are additional tags users wish to add/remove from the person at the same time. If the comamnd is `remove_tag` and the tag(s) are not found in the contact, and error will be thrown. This field is optional.

### Adding/removing persons to/from teams
Currently, to add a person to a team, one has to use the `edit` command to add a team tag to the contact. There are significant drawbacks to this:
1. User has to type out the entire team name in the team tag.
2. User has to input all the teams that the person is already in, else the edit command will remove those tags from the person.

This negatively impacts user experience as the process of adding and removing persons from teams becomes time-consuming and prone to typos.

#### Enhancement:
Instead of using the team names, users will be able to add and remove persons using the team index on the team list.

#### Suggested implementation:
Create two new commands, `add_to_team` and `remove_from_team`, both of which will have the following format:

```add_to_team <PERSON_INDEX> <TEAM_INDEX> [<TEAM_INDEX> ...]```

```remove_from_team <PERSON_INDEX> <TEAM_INDEX> [<TEAM_INDEX> ...]```

- `<PERSON_INDEX>` is the index of the person shown on the person list of the Ui. If there is no person at the given index, the command will throw an error. This field is required.
- `<TEAM_INDEX>` is the index of a team shown on the team list of the Ui. If there is no team at the given index, the command will throw an error. This field is required.
- `[<TEAM_INDEX> ...]` is/are additional teams that the user wants to add/remove a person to/from. For example, user can input `remove_from_team 1 1 2 3`, and this will remove the person at index 1 from the teams at index 1, 2, and 3. The additional team(s) are optional.


### Long Fields support

#### Person fields and team fields
Fields that are too long and are cut off by the Ui are to be truncated and indicated with ellipses.

- _E.g._ if a person name is "Salvador Felipe Jacinto DalÃ­ y Domenech" and cannot be displayed fully, the Ui should replace it with "Salvador Felipe Jac...", with the ellipses ending at the cut-off.
- Users should also be able to view the full length of the field by hovering their mouse over that particular field.
- Same goes for tags, if the tags of a contact/team takes up more than two rows, the remained will be hidden, and an indicator will appear to show how many tags are hidden
- _E.g._ A contact with 230 tags may only have 14 tags shown on the Ui, and at the end of the displayed tag a text `"... +216"` will indicate that they have 216 more tags that are hidden.

#### Tags (Skill tags, team tags, person tags)
Tags that are longer than 20 characters to be truncated on the Ui. Users can then hover their mouse over it to see the full tag.

- _E.g._ The Tag "Grandmaster in Witchcraft and Wizardry" will appear as "Grandmaster in Witch..." on the Ui.


## _Appendix:_ Effort

TeamBuilder is a brownfield project which builds upon the existing features of AB3. Our vision for TeamBuilder, although simple conceptually, proved to be challenging to implement due to AB3's pre-existing architecture. 

### Challenges with dependencies between Teams and Persons
The ability to create teams and add persons into TeamBuilder is the highlight of our project. It proved to be  monstrous task, requiring thorough changes in every component of the AB3 Architecture. 

- While AB3 only has Contacts, we wanted TeamBuilder to also have Teams, which is another entity. Teams and Persons are both dependent on each other, as a person cannot be part of a non-existent team, and a Team cannot have a non-existent person.
- Deleting person and teams proved to be a huge challenge for TeamBuilder, as when a team is deleted, any person that is part of the team has to be updated such that they no longer have that team tag. Similarly, when a person is deleted, Teams have to be updated such that that person is also removed from the team.
- Additionally, this same issue caused problems for the Storage component. Should the storage contain a person that is part of a Team that does not exist, or a Team contain a person that does not exist, TeamBuilder has to be able to catch these errors and act appropriately.

The large degree of inter-dependencies made implementing a relatively 'simple' feature such as adding a person or deleting a team to require much time and effort in understanding AB3's implementation, as well as coming up with solutions to achieve our goal.

### High effort required for test cases. 
TeamBuilder differs greatly from AB3 as all persons' fields are optional except for their name, and TeamBuilder has Teams as well as persons. As a result, sizeable chunks of tests from AB3 are not relevant, and the Team had to reformat most of the tests, as well as generate and create new Sample data to test.
