## Design

### Architecture

<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.1</b> Architecture Diagram for the high-level design of the App
</div>
<br>
The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.2</b> Sequence Diagram of delete command
</div>
<br>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.3</b> Class diagram of components
</div>
<br>
The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.4</b> Class diagram of UI
</div>
<br>
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/logic/Logic.java)
Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.5</b> Class diagram of 'Logic' component
</div>
<br>


How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `EventBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.7</b> Class diagram of 'Logic''
</div>
<br>
How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EventBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `EventBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.8</b> Class diagram of 'Model'
</div>
<br>

The `Model` component,

* stores the event book data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Event component
**API** : [`Event.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/model/event/Event.java)

<img src="images/EventClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 1.9</b> Class diagram of 'Event'
</div>
<br>

The `Event` component,

* stores each category of information of an event in individual attributes and each attribute is an object.
* arrtibutes are:
   * `Address`
   * `Mark`
   * `Name`
   * `Tag`
   * `Rate`
   * `Time`
   * `Contact`
* when an event is created the above objects are created using user inputs and then the event object will be created.
* the event will be added to the UniqueEventList.

### Contact component
**API** : [`Contact.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/model/contact/Contact.java)

<img src="images/ContactClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 2.0</b> Class diagram of 'Contact'
</div>
<br>

The `Contact` component,
- it is made up of 2 objects the `ContactName` and `ContactPhone`
- both objects are created using user input.
- the contact will be added into the UniqueContactList.


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/event/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both event book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EventBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.eventbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### New Contact feature

The `newcontact` feature allows for users to add new contacts to their contact list.

#### Implementation

The `newcontact` feature is facilitated by the `Contact` class. The feature is implemented as follows:
- encapsulate two attributes of a contact with the help of `ContactName` and `ContactPhone` class.
- Phone number should only be numerical and shall not be shorter than 8 digits.
- A contact is unique to its `ContactPhone`, having the same phone number will result in an error.
- Once a new contact is created it will be added to the contact list which will be saved in a JSON file.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new contact through creating `ContactName` and `ContactPhone` attributes.
    * Pros: More levels of abstraction to prevent the accidental change of information.
    * Cons: Complicated code.
* **Alternative 2:** Created a new contact through storing strings input by user.
    * Pros: Easy to code.
    * Cons: Might be hard to keep track or do comparisons with.

<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 3.1</b> Activity diagram of 'New Contact'
</div>

### Mark feature

The `mark` feature allows for marking of the 'Mark' attribute to indicate that the event is done.

#### Implementation

The `mark` feature is implemented with the following considerations:
- A `Mark` class facilitates the implementation of the mark feature. The class also contains a `isDone` attribute to indicate whether the event is done or not.'
- A valid `index` will be taken in as a parameter to facilitate marking of the correct event.
- Marking of a done event would not result in error or exceptions as this action does not reduce correctness of presented information.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calls on `mark` method in 'Mark' class to set the tracked boolean variable 'isDone' to true
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Results in higher coupling as it is editing a variable in an event instance, may lead to errors in runtime and testing.

* **Alternative 2:** Replace current instance of specified event with a new unmarked event instance
  * Pros: Results in less coupling and in turn lower possibility of unintended change cascades.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage and runtime.

Below shows the activity diagram of the `mark` command:

<img src="images/MarkActivityDiagram.png" width="200" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 3.2</b> Activity diagram of 'Mark'
</div>

### Unmark feature

The `unmark` feature allows for unmarking of the 'Mark' attribute in events should there be an accidental marking of an event.

#### Implementation

The `unmark` feature is implemented with the following considerations:

- A valid `index` will be taken in as a parameter to facilitate unmarking of the correct event.
- The unmark feature builds alongside the existing implementation of the 'Mark' class.
- Allows for undo of accidental marking by setting the 'isDone' boolean attribute of the 'Mark' class to false to signify an undone event.
- Unmarking of an undone event would not result in error or exceptions as this action does not reduce correctness of presented information.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calls on `unmark` method in 'Mark' class to set the tracked boolean variable 'isDone' to false
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Results in higher coupling as it is editing a variable in an event instance, may lead to errors in runtime and testing.

* **Alternative 2:** Replace current instance of specified event with a new unmarked event instance
  * Pros: Results in less coupling and in turn lower possibility of unintended change cascades.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage and runtime.

Below shows the activity diagram of the `unmark` command:

<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 3.3</b> Activity diagram of 'Unmark'
</div>

### Reminder feature
The `remind` feature allows for users to view upcoming events.

#### Implementation

The `reminder` feature is implemented with the following considerations:
* It is facilitated by `StartTimeWithinDaysPredicate`, that tests if an event's start date is within the inputted days of the current time.
* The current time is determined by a `Clock` that is created by `LogicManager`.
* The `RemindCommandParser` checks if the command argument has the correct format. The command argument represents days and should be a positive integer.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How current time is determined:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Determine current time using a `Clock` created in `LogicManager`.
    * Pros: Easy to test. A fixed `Clock` can be created.
    * Cons: Coupling between classes that use `Clock`, even if the class only uses it to create an object that uses `Clock`

* **Alternative 2:** Determine current time using `LocalDateTime.now()` in `StartTimeWithinDaysPredicate`.
    * Pros: Less coupling between classes.
    * Cons: Difficult to test, as the current time is based on real time.

    <b>Figure 3.4</b> Object diagram of objects involved in the execution of a 'remind' command
</div>

### Linkcontact feature

The link contact feature allows users to link a contact to an event.

#### Implementation
The `linkcontact` feature is facilitated by `Event` class.
The feature is implemented as follows:
* When a user adds an event, he can optionally add a contact to the event.
* When a user edits an event, he can optionally add a contact to the event.
* When a user edits an event, he can optionally change the contact of the event.
* If the user specifies a contact that does not exist in the contact list, the event will not be added/edited.
* If the user specifies a contact that already exists in the contact list, the event will be added/edited with the contact.

The linkcontact feature will take in a contact number as a parameter. This parameter will be used to search for the contact in the contact list.
1. If the contact is found, the contact will be linked to the event.
2. If the contact is not found, the event will not be added/edited.

#### Design consideration:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a `Contact` attribute to `Event` class.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May violate Single Responsibility Principle as `Event` class now has to handle both event and contact.
* **Alternative 2:** Add the `contact` as just a normal string attribute to `Event` class.
    * Pros: Even easier to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to implement filtering of events by contact in the future.

<img src="images/LinkContactActivityDiagram.png" width="430" />
<div style="width:80%;margin:0">
    <b>Figure 3.5</b> Activity diagram of 'linkcontact'
</div>

### Revenue feature

The `revenue` feature allows for calculating the total revenue earned so far.

#### Implementation

The `revenue` feature is implemented with the following considerations:
- The revenue takes into account whether the event is marked or not. It only sums up the rate if the event is marked as done.
- The revenue will display `0.00` and not result in any errors even if there are no events that are done yet.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterates through the event book when the revenue feature is called.
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Runtime complexity scales as the event book increases in size.

* **Alternative 2:** Keep a static attribute of the revenue and increase accordingly as events are completed.
  * Pros: Will maintain a low runtime complexity.
  * Cons: Hard to implement in the case that events are unmarked or deleted.

Below shows the activity diagram of the `revenue` command:

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements
1. The current `newevent` and `edit` commands allows an event's start time to be after its end time. We plan to only allow an event to be added or successfully edited if its start time is before or the same as its end time, with an error message `Start time must be before end time.` being shown otherwise.

2. The current `linkcontact` command does not recognise an inputted phone number if there are extra spaces around it. For example, `linkcontact 1      12345678` is not allowed. We plan to allow the extra spaces by ignoring extra spaces when splitting the input arguments.

3. Upon using the current `linkcontact` command on a contact that is already linked to a specified event, the application returns a `Successfully linked` message in the message display box. We plan to change the display message to `Contact already linked` instead for contacts that are already linked.

4. The current UI does not wrap text displayed into a new line, instead a scroll bar is used to scroll and view textual informations that are too long. We plan to add a text wrapping feature to provide better readability to users so that scrolling is not needed.

5. The current `edit` command is for editing events only, there is no way to edit the contact object details. We plan to implement an `edit` function for the contact objects.

6. The current contact book does not allow deleting of contacts. We plan to implement a `delete` method for deleting contacts.
