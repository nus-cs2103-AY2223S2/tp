### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

#### Interaction between architecture components

The **_Sequence Diagram_** below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) **_class diagram_** below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `MeetingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) **_class diagram_** of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `QuickcContactsParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `QuickContactsParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `QuickContactsParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMeetingList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<img src="images/ModelPersonDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Person` model,

* consists of individual classes `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address` and `Tag` which are used to store the respective information of a `Person`.

<img src="images/ModelMeetingDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Meeting` model,

* consists of individual classes `Title`, `DateTime`, `Person`, `Location` and `Description` which are used to store the respective information of a `Meeting`.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `QuickBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.quickcontacts.commons` package.

## **Feature Implementation**

### Create, Edit and Delete Operations for `Person` and `Meeting`

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features related to `Person` and `Meeting` are
implemented. `Person` and `Meeting` have similar functionality and how they are implemented are similar. Without loss of
generality, the specifications below can be applied to both class of objects, unless specified otherwise.

In this section:
* `Object` is used to represent [`Person`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/model/person/Person.java) and [`Meeting`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/model/meeting/Meeting.java)
* Correspondingly, `UniqueList` is used to represent [`UniquePersonList`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/model/person/UniquePersonList.java) and [`UniqueMeetingList`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/model/meeting/UniqueMeetingList.java)
* Correspondingly, `AddXYZCommand` is used to represent [`AddCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/commands/AddCommand.java) and [`AddMeetingCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/commands/AddMeetingCommand.java)
* Correspondingly, `EditXYZCommand` is used to represent [`EditCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/commands/EditCommand.java) and [`EditMeetingCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/commands/EditMeetingsCommand.java)
* Correspondingly, `DeleteXYZCommand` is used to represent [`DeleteCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java) and [`DeleteMeetingCommand`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/commands/DeleteMeetingCommand.java)
* Correspondingly, `AddParser` is used to represent [`AddCommandParser`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/parser/AddCommandParser.java) and [`AddMeetingCommandParser`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/parser/AddMeetingCommandParser.java)
* Correspondingly, `EditParser` is used to represent [`EditCommandParser`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/parser/EditCommandParser.java) and [`EditMeetingParser`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/parser/EditMeetingParser.java)
* Correspondingly, `DeleteParser` is used to represent [`DeleteCommandParser`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/parser/DeleteCommandParser.java) and [`DeleteMeetingCommandParser`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/quickcontacts/logic/parser/DeleteMeetingCommandParser.java)

Depending on which object functionality you are exploring, simply substitute the general object (`Object` or
`UniqueList`) with the specific object.

We write in a general so that we cover breadth, and that we may adhere to
[DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

#### Adding

##### Description
The `AddXYZCommand` handles the addition of `Object` into QuickContacts. See the syntax for `AddXYZCommand`
[here](#command-summary).

##### Implementation
When adding an `Object` the control flow is as follows:

1. The user queries the `UI` to add using the [`add` or `addm` command](#command-summary).
2. `UI` calls the `QuickContactsParser` through `LogicManager` to initiate an `AddParser` object.
3. `QuickContactsParser` then passes the arguments to the `AddParser` object.
4. `AddParser` initiates an `AddXYZCommand` object.
5. `AddXYZCommand` object is passed all the way back to `LogicManager`.
6. `LogicManager` calls `execute()` on `AddXYZCommand`.
7. `AddXYZCommand` updates the model and returns a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.
8. `LogicManager` updates the `UniqueList`.

Below is the Sequence Diagram as a concrete example for a `Person`:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add n/bob` Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Exceptions
The `AddMeetingCommand` throws a `CommandException` if the object's names is found in the address book (i.e.
no person in the address book has a matching name). The name must match exactly (**case-sensitive**) or else the
`CommandException` will be thrown.

#### Editing
##### Description
The `EditXYZCommand` is responsible for handling the editing of an `Object` in QuickContacts. It allows users to modify the
details of a specific `Object`. See the syntax for `EditXYZCommand` [here](#command-summary).

##### Implementation
When editing a meeting, the control flow is as follows:

1. The user queries the UI to edit a `Object` using the [`edit` or `editm` command](#command-summary).
2. The UI calls the `QuickContactsParser` through `LogicManager` to initiate an `EditParser` object.
3. `QuickContactsParser` then passes the arguments to the `EditParser` object.
4. `EditParser` initiates an `EditXYZCommand` object.
5. `EditXYZCommand` object is passed all the way back to `LogicManager`.
6. `LogicManager` calls `execute()` on the `EditXYZCommand`.
7. `EditXYZCommand` updates the model with the edited `Object` details and returns a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.
8. `LogicManager` updates the `UniqueList` with the new information by replacing the old with the new object.

Below is the Sequence Diagram as a concrete example for a `Person`:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit` Command](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Exceptions
`EditMeetingCommand` throws a `CommandException` if any one of the `Person`'s name is not found in QuickContacts. The
name must match exactly (**case-sensitive**).

#### Deleting
##### Description
The `DeleteXYZCommand` handles the deletion of an `Object` from QuickContacts. See the syntax for `DeleteXYZCommand`
[here](#command-summary).

##### Implementation
When deleting an `Object`, the control flow is as follows:

1. The user queries the UI to delete using the [`delete` or `delm` command](#command-summary).
2. The UI calls the `QuickContactsParser` through LogicManager to initiate a `DeleteParser` object.
3. `QuickContactsParser` then passes the arguments to the `DeleteParser` object.
4. `DeleteParser` initiates a `DeleteXYZCommand` object.
5. `DeleteXYZCommand` object is passed all the way back to `LogicManager`.
6. `LogicManager` calls `execute()` on `DeleteXYZCommand`.
7. `DeleteXYZCommand` updates the model and returns a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.
8. `LogicManager` updates the `UniquePersonList` by deleting the `Person` from it.

Below is the Sequence Diagram:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Exceptions
The `DeleteXYZCommand` throws a CommandException if the specified index is not found in QuickContacts.

### Finding `Person`

##### Description
The `FindCommand` finds persons in the address book. See the syntax for `FindCommand` [here](#command-summary).

##### Implementation
When finding meetings, the control flow is as follows:

1. The user queries the `UI` to find using a [`find`](#command-summary) command.
2. `UI` calls the `QuickContactsParser` through `LogicManager` to initiate a `FindCommandParser` object.
3. `FindCommandParser` takes in a list of names and creates a `FindCommand` object.
4. `FindCommand` is executed, and a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` is passed to the `updateFilteredPersonList` method in the `Model` component.
5. `LogicManager` creates a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, passing it to the `updateFilteredPersonList()` method in the `Model` component.
6. `UI` displays the filtered meetings to the user.

Below is the Sequence Diagram:
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Exceptions
The `FindCommand` throws a `CommandException` if no names are provided.
The names no need to match exactly (**case-INsensitive**) but the contacts are only filtered by one of the contact's names,
as *space* is used as a delimiter.

#### Difference in Meetings
##### Implementation
For meetings, the usage and implementation is similar, but the `FindMeetingCommand` will search for matching names in the
meetings list similar to `FindMeeting` and returns meetings that satisfy the search criteria
(i.e. if the meeting has at least one contact that matches the input name).
However, `findm` can be used without arguments to list all meetings. Thus, unlike `find`, `findm` will not throw `exceptions` if not given 
any arguments.

### Exporting and importing of contacts
#### Description
Exporting generates a JSON for the contacts at the indices given.
For example, `export p/1 p/2` generates a JSON for the first and second contacts.
Example JSON:
```json
[ {
  "name" : "Alice Pauline",
  "phone" : "94351253",
  "email" : "alice@example.com",
  "address" : "123, Jurong West Ave 6, #08-111",
  "tagged" : [ "friends" ]
}, {
  "name" : "Benson Meier",
  "phone" : "98765432",
  "email" : "johnd@example.com",
  "address" : "311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25",
  "tagged" : [ "owesMoney", "friends" ]
} ]
```
The JSON is generated using the Jackson library, through the use of the `JsonUtil` utility class. The JSON can be pasted in again proceeding the import command to import the information in the export command

#### Design Considerations

**Alternative 1**: Use some other format (eg. `XML` or `YAML`) for exporting

Could provide more readable and/or less text for copying.

**Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Use existing `JSON` format

Benefit: can directly copy-paste to and from the data files that already exist in the system.

#### Implementation
Here we only describe the `ExportCommand`. Import is the same, besides step 5. where it instead calls add on the model to add the specified objects in JSON (similar to how storage loads the save file)
Control flow is as follows.

1. The user queries the `UI` to export using a [export command](#command-summary).
2. `UI` calls the `QuickContactsParser` through `LogicManager` to initiate a `ExportCommandParser` object.
3. `ExportCommandParser` creates a `ExportCommand` object.
4. `ExportCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` executes `ExportCommand`.
6. `ExportCommand` queries `ModelManager` for JSON string.
7. `ExportCommand` returns JSON string to `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`.
8. `UI` outputs the JSON string.

Below is the Sequence Diagram:
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `export` Command](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Difference in Meetings
##### Implementation
Meetings  has additional functionality of returning meetings between two dates. This is implemented through the use of a
`isBetween` function implemented in the `Meeting` class. The program will first gather all the meetings in the
corresponding indexes provided, then search for meetings between the start and end dates. If either date is empty, then
only the other date is considered.

##### Exceptions
Using the exported JSON, one can then import it using `import VALID_JSON`.

Before importing, a check is done to make sure there are no duplicate values. This is done before the actual importing
to ensure we do not have "half imports".

Consider a situation where we have `[Person2, Person3]` in the system. If we
import `[Person1, Person2, Person3, Person4]` without considering duplicates first, Person1 will be imported
followed by the import of Person2 throwing a DuplicatePersonError, resulting in the command throwing a failure
message and Person4 not being imported but the system now has `[Person1, Person2, Person3]`.
The JSON is parsed using the Jackson library. If the Jackson library is unable to parse the json, an error message
is thrown.

However, if the user wishes to "force import", a `f/` parameter is provided. This imports for each `Person` if the
Person does not already exist, and ignores those that do.
This allows the previous situation to complete with `[Person1, Person2, Person3, Person4]` in the system.

### Autocompletion of Argument Prefixes

Autocompletion of command inputs is facilitated by the individual command parsers (`XYZCommandParser`) which are
implementing the `Parser` interface in the `Logic` component. Each `XYZCommandParser` implements how autocompletion
should work for that particular command by overriding `Parser#getAutocompleteSuggestion`. This action is triggered when
the user presses `TAB` when the command input starts with a valid command.

The `CommandBox` UI component is actively listening for `TAB` keystrokes by having a `KeyPressedHandler` which will
trigger `XYZCommandParser#getAutocompleteSuggestion`. A `AutocompleteResult` would then be returned to the `CommandBox`
which contains the `Prefix` to be appended to the current command input, or used to replace the last `Prefix` in the
current command input.

#### Design Considerations

**Alternative 1**: Autocomplete by appending the next relevant `Prefix` that is missing

* This will be easier to implement as all we need is to have a list of `Prefix` that is relevant for the command and
cycle through and append those that are missing from the current command input.
* Checking for missing `Prefix` from the command input can be achieved with the help of `ArgumentTokenizer`.
* Downside: some commands such as `edit` does not need all the `Prefix` as user might just want to modify two
attributes. Simply cycling through and appending missing `Prefix` might require users to backspace some
unnecessary `Prefix`.

**Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Autocomplete by custom behaviour depending on the command

* This would require each `XYZCommandParser` to implement their own behaviour on how autocompletion should
behave for that particular command.
* Benefit: There is more flexibility in customising how to best cater autocompletion for each individual
command to better the user experience.

### Traversal of Commands

Traversal of commands is facilitated by `CommandHistory` model in addition to `KeyPressedHandler` in the `CommandBox` UI component.

Internally, `CommandHistory` utilises [`LinkedList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) to store all the commands that have been executed by the user. Traversal of the list is facilitated by a `static` pointer.

`CommandBox` UI component is actively listening to the `UP` and `DOWN` keys which would be handled by the `KeyPressedHandler`, which is responsible for traversing the command history using `CommandHistory`.

The activity diagram below provides a visual representation of the flow of actions when the `UP` and `DOWN` keys are pressed.

![Activity Diagram for Command Traversal](images/CommandTraversalActivityDiagram.png)

### DateTime parsing

Storing of `dateTime` (date and/or time) of `Meeting` is facilitated by `DateTime`.

The `dateTime` of a `Meeting` requires users to input a date, but leaves the time of the meeting to be optional. Internally, `DateTime` stores the date using [`LocalDate`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html) and the time using [`LocalTime`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalTime.html). However, since the time is an optional field, the optionality of the time is implemented by wrapping `LocalTime` with the Java [`Optional`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) class.  This brings about various benefits and is further discussed below.

Moreover, `DateTime` allows for various formats of parsing in a `dateTime` value (22/02 3.30PM, 2202 1530, 22.02.2023 etc). This is facilitated by first having a list of formats for dates and times separately. Moreover, separators (`.`, `:`, `/` etc) are maintained and inserted for each format dynamically. For example:

* `dd{SEP}MM{SEP}yyyy` specifies the format for `dd/MM/yyyy`, `dd.MM.yyyy` and `dd-MM-yyyy` for separators `/`, `.` and `-` respectively.

This way, formats are easily extensible and maintainable. The parsing of `dateTime` inputs into `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` objects are facilitated by breaking up the input into 2 parts: date and time, before using `LocalDate#parse` and `LocalTime#parse` respectively.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to encapsulate the time of a `Meeting` which is optional**

* **Alternative 1**: Have the time set to `null` if user does not provide the time.
  * This would risk [`NullPointerException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html) being thrown if the time is not provided but there are attempts of accessing the time.
  * As a result of the point above, there will be many instances of null checks, which would contribute to unnecessary code verbosity.
* **Alternative 2**: Make use of `LocalTime.MAX` to represent that the time is not provided.
  * This alternative removes the risk of `NullPointerException` that comes with Alternative 1.
  * However, there would still be many instances of checks whether the time equals to `LocalTime.MAX`, which would contribute to unnecessary code verbosity.
* **Alternative 3 (current choice)**: Utilise Java `Optional` to wrap the time.
  * By doing so, there will not be any `NullPointerException` and enables us to make use of the provided methods (`orElse` etc.) that helps to carry out the logic based on the presence of the time.

### Sort Meeting commands (only in meetings)
#### Sorting
##### Description
The `SortMeetingCommand` is a Java class that allows the user to sort meetings stored in a `Model` object based on a specified attribute, such as title, date and time, location, or description. The sorting is done by creating a `Comparator` for the specified attribute and passing it to the `sortFilteredMeetingList` method in the `Model` object. See the syntax here [sort command](#command-summary).
##### Implementation

When sorting meetings, the control flow is as follows:
1. The user issues a sort command with the desired attribute and optional reverse flag.
2. The `UI` calls the `QuickContactsParser` through `LogicManager` to initiate a `SortMeetingCommandParser` object.
3. The `SortMeetingCommandParser` parses the command and creates a `SortMeetingCommand` object.
4. The `SortMeetingCommand` is executed, and the correct `Comparator` for the specified attribute is applied to the `Model` object's `sortFilteredMeetingList` method.
5. `LogicManager` returns a `CommandResult` to the `UI` with a success message indicating the attribute by which the meetings have been sorted.

Below is the Sequence Diagram:
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sortm` Command](images/SortMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)



### Light Theme
The current theme is stored as a boolean inside GuiSettings, which is stored inside UserPrefs. Clicking the button
toggles the boolean and removes the current stylesheet (eg. LightTheme.css/DarkTheme.css) and adds the opposite
stylesheet to the scene.

2. To simulate data file is corrupted:

   1. Prerequisite: `QuickContacts` is currently not running and the data files have been generated.

   2. Open `quickcontacts.json` with a text editor, add a few random characters and save it.

   3. Launch `QuickContacts`.

   Expected: A warning message will be displayed and `QuickContacts` will start from an empty data file.

3. To simulate restoring data from a backup data file:

   1. Prerequisite: `QuickContacts` is currently not running and the data files have been generated and you have the backup file ready. Assume that the backup file is named `quickcontacts.json.backup`.

   2. Delete `quickcontacts.json` from the directory that contains `quickcontacts.jar`.

   3. Move `quickcontacts.json.backup` into the same directory as `quickcontacts.jar`.

   5. Launch `QuickContacts`.

   Expected: `QuickContacts` will launch normally with the data restored from the backup.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements
1. Currently, the UI shows a blank area when an attribute is undefined for contacts and meetings.

    Proposed Fix: Have a placeholder `No ATTRIBUTE defined` for each undefined attribute.
2. Currently, once we define an attribute for a contact, we are unable to remove it.
    
    Proposed Fix: Add a new command "deleteattribute" for this purpose. For example, `deleteattribute p/1 e/`
    to remove email for a contact or `deleteattribute m/1 des/` to remove description for a meeting.
