### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />
###### Figure 1

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tfifteenfour/clipboard/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tfifteenfour/clipboard/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete student 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
###### Figure 2

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
###### Figure 3

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tfifteenfour/clipboard/ui/Ui.java) and uses the JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tfifteenfour/clipboard/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

![UI Packages](images/UiPageComponents.png)
###### Figure 4: Packages in the UI component

As CLIpboard is a multi-page application, it is made up of different UI components corresponding to each page. The UI classes relevant to each page are classified in their own individual packages as shown in Figure 3.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
###### Figure 5


The UI also consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `HelpWindow`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.
These parts also remain visible as the user navigates through the different pages in the GUI.

#### Initialising the UI

![Homepage](images/UiHomePage.png)

###### Figure 6: CLIpboard landing page

The `UiManager` is a controller class containing the `start` method which initialises the UI in the following sequence:

1. Instantiate a new `MainWindow` object.
2. `show` the `MainWindow` object.
3. Populate the UI window using the the `fillInnerParts` method of `MainWindow`.

The `MainWindow#fillInnerParts` method will populate the UI by:
1. Populating the Left Pane with a `CourseListPanel`.
2. Populating the `pageTab`
3. Populating the `commandBox`
4. Populating the `resultDisplay`
5. Populating the `statusBarFooter`

As shown in Figure 6, users will be shown the Course Page upon launching the application. The GUI will then refresh accordingly as the user navigates through the different pages in the application.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tfifteenfour/clipboard/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
###### Figure 7

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `RosterParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete student 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete course 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
###### Figure 8

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
###### Figure 9

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `RosterParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `RosterParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tfifteenfour/clipboard/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
###### Figure 10


The `Model` component,

* stores the roster data i.e., all `Course` objects (which can subsequently be traversed to access all stored data)
* stores a `CurrentSelection` object that is a container object for pointing to the various `Course`/`Group`/`Student`/`Session`/`Task` objects that the user has selected.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores the `Command` object that was last executed, as well as its corresponding command string input, for purposes of accessing previous states (i.e like in the case of `undo` command)
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Detailed implementation of `Course` can be found under [Implementation section](#implementation).




### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tfifteenfour/clipboard/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />
###### Figure 11

The `Storage` component,
* can save both roster data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `RosterStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tfifteenfour.clipboard.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### User Interface Implementation

This subsection describes implementation details related to `UI`, such as page navigation and design.

#### Navigating through pages

![Navigation Guide](images/navigation.png)

###### Figure 12: CLIpboard navigation guide

As shown in Figure 12, users can navigate through the application using a combination of `select`, `task`, `session`, and `back` commands.
When a command such as `select` is called, the left pane or the right pane, or both, will be refreshed in `MainWindow`.


![Select Sequence Diagram](images/SelectSequenceDiagram.png)

###### Figure 13: Sequence Diagram for `select`


Figure 13's Sequence Diagram depicts how the `UI`, `Logic`, and `Model` components interact when `select 1` is called on the Course Page. The user's selection path (in this case `Course` -> `Group`) is tracked by the `CurrentSelection` class as they navigate from the Course Page to the Group Page.

To display the Group Page after the user selects a `Course` from the Course Page, the `UI` first obtains the `PageType` to be displayed in the GUI from the `Logic` component. Then, the `UI` retrieves the selected `Course` from `CurrentSelection` and subsequently invokes the `showGroupPane` method based on the selected `Course`.

Before creating the `GroupListPanel` to display the groups in the selected `Course`, the UI obtains an `ObservableList<Group>` from the selected `Course` in the `Model` component.
Each `Group` in the `ObservableList<Group>` is then mapped into a `GroupListViewCell` in `GroupListPanel`.
At the end of the `showGroupPane` method call, the Left Pane, previously populated by the `CourseListPanel`, will be refreshed to show the `GroupListPanel`

This sequence of interactions is similar across each page navigation.

#### Design considerations

- **Attendance Page Design**

![Attendance Page](images/UiAttendancePageDesign.png)

###### Figure 14: Screenshot of Attendance Page*


In Figure 14, we have a screenshot of the student page, with the Left Pane and Right Pane populated with a `SessionListPanel` and an `AttendanceListPanel` respectively.
The navigation from Session Page to Attendance Page does not close the `SessionListPanel`, instead the `SessionListPanel` remain displayed in the Left Pane and the `AttendanceListPanel` is displayed in the Right Pane.
However, the current page shown in Figure 14 is still treated as the Attendance Page, hence only commands applicable to the Attendance Page is accepted.
This also applies to the Grades Page, when the `SessionListPanel` is displayed alongside the `GradesListPanel`.

Initially, each student in the Attendance Page will be marked as absent and their individual student cards will be shown in red.
After marking a student's attendance with the `mark` command, the student card will be changed to green.
This change occurs immediately after the command execution by generating a new `AttendanceListPanel` when a `mark` command is called.
Figure 15 shows the Sequence Diagram when a `mark` command is executed.

![Mark Sequence Diagram](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)

###### Figure 15: Sequence Diagram of mark command. Due to Plant UML limitations, the `alt` frame extends slightly beyond the `UI` frame.

As shown in Figure 15, when a new `AttendanceListPanel` is initialised, an `AttendanceListViewCell` will be created.
Similar to the sequence described under Figure 13, the `AttendanceListPanel` takes in an `ObservableList<StudentWithAttendance>` and maps each `StudentWithAttendance` into an `AttendanceListViewCell`.
Each `StudentWithAttendance` has an `attendance` flag to indicate if they are present or absent for a particular session.
Based on the flag, either a new `PresentAttendanceListCard` (with a green background) or a new `AbsentAttendanceListCard` (with a red background) will be created for the particular student.

- **Student Page Design**

![Student Page](images/UiStudentPageDesign.png)

###### Figure 16: Screenshot of Student Page

In Figure 16, we have a screenshot of the student page, with the Left Pane and Right Pane populated with a `StudentListPanel` and a `StudentViewCard` respectively.
The user interface has a straightforward dashboard layout that uses a list panel to display Courses, Groups, Sessions, Tasks, or Students in the Left Pane.
Since we are on the student page, a list of students is shown.
Unlike the Attendance and Grades Page, even though both Left and Right Panes are populated, the page shown in Figure 15 is still the Student Page, hence commands which are applicable to the Student Page are accepted here.


##### Alternative considerations


![StudentListCard](images/UiStudentListCard.png)

###### Figure 17: A student list card*

Instead of `StudentId`, we initially considered displaying the `Course` and `Group` the student belongs to in their individual student cards.
However, this information is already displayed in the navigation bar (shown in Figure 15, above the `StudentListPanel` in "CS2103T > T15").
Furthermore, since each `Student` is uniquely identified by their `StudentId` (i.e adding another student with the same `StudentId` to the same `Group` will throw an error message), it would be more useful to display their `StudentId` instead.

Another alternative we considered was displaying the full information of a `Student` in each `StudentListCard`, however doing so will quickly overwhelm the `StudentListPanel` if there were many students in the group.
As such, we have implemented a separate `StudentViewCard` that will be shown on the Right Pane (as shown in Figure 15) when the user enters a `select` command on the Student Page.

#### CLIpboard Theme

Most of the CLIpboard style components can be found in the CSS file `BrownTheme.css`, found under `src/main/resources/view`.

Below is the colour palette used for CLIpboard. CLIpboard mainly adopts brown tones to reflect a wooden traditional clipboard.

**Main colours:**

![A1826D](images/colour-palette/A1826D.png) **#A1826D** : A chestnut-brown colour.

![D8B4A4](images/colour-palette/D8B4A4.png) **#D8B4A4** : A light sandy brown used for the background.

**Accent colours:**

![574539](images/colour-palette/574539.png) **#574539** : A darker shade of brown, mainly used for lettering and page tabs.

![B56D5E](images/colour-palette/B56D5E.png) **#B56D5E** : A reddish-brown accent for `StudentId` in Student Page.

![8B3A3A](images/colour-palette/8B3A3A.png) **#8B3A3A** : A deep red colour used for students marked as absent.

![5EB56D](images/colour-palette/5EB56D.png) **#5EB56D** : A light green colour used for students marked as present.

CLIpboard also utilises two primary fonts, namely the Open Sans font family and the Satoshi font family.
Both are free to use, and can be downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [FontShare](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi) respectively.

**Open Sans:**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Student Roster Object Types
In our implementation, we have defined several object types that accurately represent the student roster, including
`Course`, `Group`, `Session`, `Task`, and `Student`. These object types are interdependent and have been designed to
work together seamlessly to provide a comprehensive solution for managing the student roster.

#### Object Dependencies
To simplify the management of the student roster and improve the user experience, we have established dependencies
between these objects. For example, when a student is added or edited in a `Group`, any changes will cascade to the
list of students in the `Session` object as well. This ensures consistency across the different object types and
reduces the risk of inconsistencies between related objects.

#### Implementation Details
The dependencies between these objects have been implemented using a combination of object-oriented design principles
and programming techniques. The specific implementation details are beyond the scope of this document, but the
following high-level overview may be useful:

Each object type has been defined as a separate class with its own set of properties and methods.
The relationships between these object types have been established using object references.
Changes to one object type will trigger an update to the related object types by means of cascading method calls.
Overall, the implementation of these object types and their dependencies has been designed to provide a robust,
scalable, and user-friendly solution for managing the student roster. Given below is the class diagram omitting most of the details.

![ObjectDependencyClassDiagram](images/ObjectDependencyClassDiagram.png)
###### Figure 17


In addition to the above diagram, the following object diagram illustrate a more comprehensive view of the dependencies between various objects during the program's runtime.

![ObjectDependencyObjectDiagram](images/ObjectDependencyObjectDiagram.png)
###### Figure 18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Undo feature
`undo` allows restoring up to 5 previous states, but can be modified to restore more/less states.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  Allowing more states to be saved, or adding more information to be tied to a state, will deteriorate CLIpboard's performance.
</div>

If new commands are to be added, it's interaction with `undo` must be kept in mind:
* For typical commands that do CRUD operations on roster data, `undo` can handle them.
* For navigating and UI related commands, some extra handling may be needed to also restore and refresh the UI to the previous state (e.g `undo` of `select` command has special handling to refresh GUI elements).

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)
###### Figure 19

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire `Roster`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unique list of items
Represented by the `UniqueList<T>` class, where `T` is the type of the item to be contained.

`UniqueList` is an abstract class that was created to accommodate the storing of different types of items which require list operations. This class provides a generalized solution that can be applied to various scenarios where a list of unique items is needed.

While `UniqueList<T>` provides some basic list operations, a child class has to be extended from it to override the more intricate operations that require different types of handling for different types of objects. Only the methods that are `abstract` need to be overriden.

The `UniqueList`'s in CLIpboard are:
1. `UniqueCoursesList`
2. `UniqueGroupsList`
3. `UniqueStudentsList`
4. `UniqueSessionsList`
5. `UniqueTaskslist`

#### Proposed Future Improvement

The extra work of creating child classes of `UniqueList` can be tedious.

A possible improvement would be allowing `UniqueList` to be an instantiable class, and at the same time create an interface `ListableItem` to represent objects to be contained in `UniqueList`.

The `ListableItem` interface would require that its classes also support the handling of list operations that were previously handled by a child class of `UniqueList`. This would then allow `UniqueList` to be generalisable to any `ListableItem` object, without the need of creating child classes of `UniqueList`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Serialized Objects for `Storage`
Found in `src/main/storage/serializedclasses`, these classes are for serializing a `Roster` and its containing objects into `json` objects, or vice versa.
This serves to store/load data to/from a plaintext json file.

##### During loading of data
Loading in of data (if a data file exists) is done once during the initialization of the program. The sequence diagram below illustrates how `MainApp` creates a `Model` containing the saved data, through interactions with `Storage`.
![LoadingStorageSequenceDiagram](images/LoadingStorageSequenceDiagram.png)
###### Figure 20

##### During saving of data
Saving of data is done every time a command is executed. The sequence diagram below illustrates how a `Roster` is saved into storage.
![SavingStorageSequenceDiagram](images/SavingStorageSequenceDiagram.png)
###### Figure 21

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the `Roster` every time a command is executed.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Redundant saving operations executed on commands that don't modify any data.

* **Alternative 2:** Save the `Roster` only when data has been modified.
  * Pros: Optimized performance as saving is only done when needed.
  * Cons: Need to maintain an extra flag in `Command` or `CommandResult` on whether a command has modified data.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Planned Enhancements**

### Unable to see long texts
Currently CLIpboard's UI automatically truncates very long strings, however the whole string is unable to be seen.
#### Proposed Changes:
* Alternative 1: Show full text when mouse hovers over the long string
    * Pros: Provides a solution without potentially cluttering the UI.
    * Cons: Involving mouse action might diminish our selling point as a CLI app optimised for keyboard users.
* Alternative 2: Text wrapping
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Could clog up the UI.

### After executing `find`, the list cannot be refreshed
After the user calls `find student` in the Students page, they are unable to display the original unfiltered list again.
#### Proposed Changes:
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Get the user to use the `undo` command
    * Pros: No need to implement a new command.
    * Cons: Does not feel intuitive.
* Alternative 2: Implement a `list` command that displays the unfiltered list
    * Pros: Intuitive for the user.
    * Cons: We are unable to implement it in v1.4 due to the feature freeze.

### Orderings of students in Attendance Page and Students Page are not standardised
Currently, the ordering of the student list in Students Page is not consistent with that in the Attendance Page.
#### Proposed Changes:
* Alternative 1: Save the student list from the Students Page to transfer it to the Attendance Page
    * Pros: Ordering is standardised everytime.
    * Cons: Might slow the performance down.

## Appendix: Effort
##### Multiple Object Types
One of the main challenges we faced was establishing dependencies between the various object types in a way that
ensured consistency and minimized data duplication. This is in contrast to AB3 which has only 1 main object type (`Person`) to manipulate in the `AddressBook`.
Detailed implementation is described under [Implementation](#student-roster-object-types).

##### Page Navigation
As CLIpboard has multiple different pages to display different types of objects at a given time. So, we needed to keep track of the current page, and the possible pages to navigate to.

Additionally, navigating a page also meant traversing the object hierarchy, and we had to store a pointer to the objects selected by the user. All these were done through the `CurrentSelection` class.

Adding page navigation added more factors to be considered. These include restricting certain commands to only be allowed on certain pages, commands executing differently depending on the current page, and handling the loading of appropriate GUI elements respective to the page.

##### Storage
As compared to AB3, CLIpboard maintains several more types of objects to store. These added types of objects needed their own respective classes to serialize them into `json` objects.

The added types also had a specific hierarchy (e.g `Roster` -> `Course` -> `Group` -> `Student`), different data fields, as well as a deeper serialization depth than AB3, which required further modification to the storage classes to handle.
