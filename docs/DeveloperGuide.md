### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Patient` and `Appointment` objects
* residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a Patient).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePatientList` object), and all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueAppointmentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient` and `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>`/`ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Patient` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Patient` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AppointmentListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add patient (`add_patient`) command

**Overview**

Adds a patient to the patient list.

**Implementation**

Steps executed in adding a patient:

1. The user executes `add_patient n/Johnâ€¦` to add a new patient.

2. `AddPatientCommand` checks if the fields are valid and if the patient already exists.

3. `AddPatientCommand` calls `Model#addPatient()`, which adds the patient to the `UniquePatientList`.

4. The application will then save the patient into the `UniquePatientList` and display the patient added.

The sequence diagram below shows how `AddPatientCommand` is parsed:

![Sequence diagram for add patient parser](images/AddPatientParserSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows how `AddPatientCommand` works:

![Sequence diagram for add patient](images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design considerations**

Instead of having separate commands for adding patients and appointments, we could have a single add command and use it
to add both patients and appointments as well as any other things we could add to the application in future. However, we
went with the separate command implementation since:
* The adding of separate commands was easier to implement.
* We currently only support adding patients and appointments, for which it would be overkill to implement the other choice.
* Having a general add command would add too many prefixes to the command, which would be troublesome for both the user and the developer to handle.

Drawbacks of the current implementation:
* Remembering the different commands for addition might be troublesome for the user.

### Edit patient (`edit_patient`) command

**Overview**

Edits a patient in the patient list. Patient names cannot be modified.

**Implementation**

The edit command edits a patient in the patient list by first finding the patient, creating a new `EditPatientDescriptor` based on the original patient, modifying that object with the given parameters, then replacing the patient in the model's patient list with a new patient constructed using the given `EditPatientDescriptor`.

**Design considerations**

One way to reduce the amount of overhead in each edit command is to store only the relevant changes for each edit command in `EditPatientDescriptor`. This would remove the need to make a copy of every field of the original patient which would save some time. However, this would require `EditCommand#execute()` to have to check for each field's presence, through something like an `Optional`. This would also involve making `Patient` mutable, which would make it difficult to ensure that the patient list stays valid after various commands.

### Add appointment (`add_appt`) command

**Overview**

Adds an appointment to the appointment list. Adding an appointment updates the calendar as well.

**Implementation**

Steps executed in adding a patient:

1. The user executes `add_appt n/Johnâ€¦` to add a new appointment.

2. `AddAppointmentCommand` checks if the fields are valid, if the patient is already exists and if the appointment already exists.

3. `AddAppointmentCommand` calls `Model#addAppointment()`, which adds the appointment to the `UniqueAppointmentList`.

4. The application will then save the appointment into the `UniqueAppointmentList` and display the appointment added and update the calendar.

The sequence diagram below shows how `AddAppointmentCommand` is parsed:

![Sequence diagram for add patient parser](images/AddAppointmentParserSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows how `AddAppointmentCommand` works:

![Sequence diagram for add patient](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design considerations**

Similar to add patient, instead of having separate commands for adding patients and appointments, we could have a single add command and use it
to add both patients and appointments as well as any other things we could add to the application in future.

More details have already been discussed in the `add_patient` section.

### Edit appointment (`edit_appt`) command

**Overview**

Edits an appointment in the appointment list. Editing appointment may update calendar if there is a change in date/time.

**Implementation**

The edit appointment command edits an appointment in the appointment list by finding the appointment, creating a new `EditAppointmentDescriptor` based on the original appointment, modifying that object with the given parameters, then replacing the appointment in the model's appointment list with a new appointment constructed using the given `EditAppointmentDescriptor`.

**Design considerations**

Similar to `edit`, storing the relevant changes for each edit command instead of storing every field of the appointment would make the edit appointment command more efficient. However, making any model mutable is undesirable as immutability allows us to easily ensure certain properties about the internal list of patients and appointments.

### Find patient (`find_patient`) and find patient by details (`find_patient_details`) commands

**Overview**

Finds a patient from the patient list and updates the displayed patient list. `find` will only match keywords to patient names, while `find_details` will match keywords to all of a patient's fields, including address and tags.

**Implementation**

The find and find details commands offer two ways of finding a patient to view their info. `find` is less comprehensive, and only searches for by patient name, while `find_details` tries to find a match in a patient's details, including their phone, address, email and tags. Both utilise a `Predicate<Patient>` in order to filter `model`'s appointment list via `Model#updateFilteredPatientList(Predicate<Patient>)`. `find` uses a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, while `find_details` uses a `DetailsContainKeywordsPredicate`.

Both predicates work in a similar fashion as they implement Java's base `Predicate` interface. `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Patient)` takes the patient's full name, turns it into a `List<String>`, and checks if any of the keywords match any word in the name. `DetailsContainKeywordsPredicate#test(Patient)` calls `Patient#getDetailsAsList()` and matches the keywords against that list of all the patient's details instead.

**Design considerations**

The two commands are very similar. Currently, they only differ in their predicate's type, and have the same `execute` method implementation. An alternative way of implementing `find_details` would be to change `FindCommand`'s constructor to accept a `Predicate<Patient>` instead, and `FindCommandParser` to create the correct type of `Predicate`.

We chose to use two different commands as we expect to expand upon the find commands differently in the future, such as allowing partial matches for `find` but not `find_details`. The details of a patient often include too many words for partial matching to be relevant. Thus, decoupling the commands from each other allows future extension of the commands to be easier.

### Find appointment (`find_appt`) command

**Overview**

Finds an appointment from the appointment list given a time or timeslot and updates the displayed appointment list. If only one time is provided, appointments that occur during that time will be found. If two times are provided, all appointments that occur anytime during that time period will be found.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find_appt 19032023 08:30` Command](images/FindAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

A more detailed view of the way the predicate is created is shown below.

![Predicate creation for the `find_appt 19032023 08:30` Command](images/FindAppointmentPredicateSequenceDiagram.png)

**Implementation**

The find appointment command utilises a `Predicate<Appointment>` in order to filter `model`'s appointment list via `Model#updateFilteredAppointmentList(Predicate<Appointment>)`. The type of `Predicate` is determined during parsing, where a single date time in the command will use a `TimeInTimeslotPredicate`, while two date times in the command will result in a `AppointmentDuringTimePredicate` being used instead.

`TimeInTimeslotPredicate#test(Appointment)` checks if the time in the command is during the timeslot of the given appointment.  `AppointmentDuringTimePredicate#test(Appointment)` checks if the given timeslot in the command overlaps with the timeslot of the given appointment.

**Design considerations**

We chose to use a single command instead of two different commands like `find` and `find_details` since the functionality of the two types of appointment finding commands is very similar, and unlikely to change in the future.

### Today (`today`) command

**Overview**

The today command updates the appointment list to show appointments that occur today.

**Implementation**

The command is equivalent to running the `find_appt` command with the start time being `00:00` of the current date, and the end time being `23:59` of the current date. For more implementation details, refer to the [`find_appt` command](#find-appointment--findappt--command).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete patient (`delete_patient`) command

**Overview**

Deletes a patient from the patient list. Also deletes any appointments for the patient from the appointment list. This will update calendar accordingly.

![sequence diagram for delete patient](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram-0.png)

**Implementation**

The delete patient command allows the user to delete an existing patient from MediMeet. This is executed by filtering `model` list via `Model#getPatientList()` and obtaining a `lastShownList` list. The patient to be removed is identified by the index according to the filtered list. All appointments related to the patient will also be deleted. This is executed in the `ModelManager` by using a for loop to remove appointments with the target patient name.

### Delete appointment (`delete_appt`) command

**Overview**

Deletes an appointment from the appointment list. Calendar is updated accordingly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**

![Sequence diagram for delete appointment](images/DeleteApptSequenceDiagram-0.png)

The delete appointment command allows the user to delete an existing appointment from MediMeet. This is executed by filtering `model` list via `Model#getAppointmentList()` and obtaining a `lastShownList` list. The appointment to be removed is identified by the index according to the filtered list.

**Design considerations**

We originally wanted to identify Appointments by their `AppointmentId` instead of their index as we expect to identify each appointment by their own unique IDs. However, we chose to use indexes in a similar fashion to patients so that users would not need to confuse themselves with two different types of commands.

### Add patient notes (`remark_patient`) command

**Overview**

Adds a note to an existing patient in the patient list.

**Implementation**

The add patient notes command adds a remark or note as a field to an existing patient in the patient list. This is done following the same flow as the `edit_patient` command, i.e, the command edits an existing remark field for the patient.

**Design considerations**

We debated on whether we wanted to make the `Remark` field editable but decided against it in the end.

These were the **factors** informing our decision:
* If we decided to make the field editable, appending any remark to the previous remark would have been easy, but removing any part of the previous remark would be quite difficult without making the command format unnecessarily complex.
* If we decided to make the field editable, we would possibly need to add another UI element just to handle remarks in order to create the existing UI uncluttered.
* On the other hand, editing remarks would make it easier for doctors to maintain patient records.

In the end, we settled on not making the `Remark` field editable for ease of implementation.

### Help (`help`) command

**Overview**

Creates popup message to assist help.

![Sequence diagram for delete appointment](images/HelpSequenceDiagram-0.png)

**Implementation**

The help command creates a pop up window message redirecting the user to the user guide. This is executed by passing a boolean `showHelp = true` into `CommandResult`. In `MainWindow`, the boolean `CommandResult.isShowHelp()` is set to true and will execute the `handleHelp()` method. This method will check if the help window is already showing. If it is not, it will open the window for the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View patient card (`view`) command

**Overview**

Creates popup message for user to fully view patient card of desired index.

![Sequence diagram for delete appointment](images/ViewSequenceDiagram-0.png)

**Implementation**

The view command creates a pop up window message displaying the patient card to the user. This is executed by passing a boolean `showHelp = true` as well as the `index` of the desired patient into `CommandResult`. In `MainWindow`, the boolean `CommandResult.isView()` is set to true and will execute the `handleView()` method. This method will check if the view window is already showing. If it is not, it will open the window for the user.

### List patients (`list_patient`) command

**Overview**

Lists all patients in the patient list in the patient panel.

**Implementation**

`list.execute(Model model)` updates the filtered patient list in `model` to show all patients by passing the predicate `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PATIENTS` to `model.updateFilteredPatientList(Predicate<Patient> predicate)`. This predicate is a static field in `Patient` that returns true for all patients.

### List appointments (`list_appt`) command

**Overview**

Displays all appointments in `ModelManager.appointmentList` to the appointment panel. This will update the calendar accordingly.

**Implementation**
`ListAppointmentCommand.execute(Model model)` updates the filtered appointment list in `model` to show all appointments by passing the predicate `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_APPOINTMENTS` to `model#updateFilteredAppointmentList(Predicate<Appointment> predicate)`. This predicate is a static field in `Appointment` that returns true for all appointments. The calendar is then updated by calling `CalendarCard.addAppointmentsToCalendar(model.getFilteredAppointmentList())`.

### Clear (`clear`) command

**Overview**

The clear command deletes all patients and appointments from the patient and appointment list respectively. This will update the calendar accordingly.

**Implementation**

`ClearCommand.execute(Model model)` passes a `new AddressBook()` to `model#setAddressBook()` and a `new AppointmentList()` to `model#setAppointmentList()`. This will clear the patient and appointment list respectively.

### Exit (`exit`) command

**Overview**

The exit command exits the application.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
3. Should load quickly and be responsive, even with a large amount of patient data.
4. Should be reliable, with minimal errors that could impact the doctor's ability to manage their appointments and patient details.
5. Should use clear and concise language, icons, and design elements to help the doctor understand the information presented and the actions they can take.
6. Should provide clear and easily accessible help and documentation, including FAQs and tutorials, to assist the doctor in using the platform effectively.
7. Should be designed to prevent errors and provide clear, actionable error messages if errors occur, so that the doctor can quickly correct any issues.


### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Availability**: The date/time the user is open to taking appointments for

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Known feature flaws
1. `view` command popup:
   * The popup window showing patient information is too small, and needs to be resized manually. Refer: https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/issues/109
     * **Proposed solution** : Set minimum size for view command window
   * view popup cannot be closed via the CLI: refer https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/issues/109 for more details.
     * **Proposed solution** : Add a shortcut to close the popup window.
   * The popup does not provide a label for each field currently (for example, the user's email is not labelled as "Email:"). Refer: https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/issues/114
     * **Proposed solution** : Add labels to the fields in the view command popup
2. The length of the patient's fields are not limited. If the user inputs an arbitrarily long input for any of the fields, the display of the application will be messed up. Refer: https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/issues/134 for more details.
   * **Proposed solution** : limit the length of each field to reasonable numbers. For example, addresses and emails can be limited to 300 characters, and phone numbers can be limited to 20 characters.
3. Calendar related bugs:
   * The popup displayed when a date is clicked does not disappear when the user clicks outside the calendar.
