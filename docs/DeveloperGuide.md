# **1. Introduction**

---

## **Software Overview**
EduMate is a desktop app designed for NUS students to manage their academic and social lives. It is optimised for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If the user can quickly, EduMate can complete contact and module management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

---

## **Intended Audience**
This guide is intended primarily for developers who want to work on the **EduMate** Software code base at [https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Getting started:** To get started, you'll want to set up your [Development Environment](#2-development-environment) and make sure you understand the branching strategy described in the [Version Control](#version-control) section and how to make a pull request. Thorough [testing](#5-testing) is expected for all pull requests, such that all testable methods are amply tested.

## **Version Control**
### **The `master` Branch**

The `master` branch represents stable released versions of the **EduMate** software. It is expected that this version always works as expected.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning::warning: You must not merge a PR into the branch if it fails some tests.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:heavy_check_mark: Instead, you should fork from this master branch into your own repo and work on new features on a branch off your own repo. Your `master` branch should always be synced with the upstream `master` branch.

</div>

### **How to Make a Pull Request**

Once you've made changes to your branch, create a Pull Request (PR) on the upstream `master` branch and link the PR with any relevant issues and milestones.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning::warning: You must not review and merge your own PR. Instead, wait for somebody else to review it for you. In this way, we can cross-check each others' code, leading to fewer errors.

</div>

## **Sample Data**

Sample data for **EduMate** can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/sampleData.txt). It is a set of 100 persons with procedurally-generated fields.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** Each row represents a person's information, with the `|` separating the different fields.

In order, they are: `name|phone|email|address|telegram|groups|modules`. Note that groups and modules are separated by a space.

</div>

For example, `Bee Shan|81121128|beeshan@gmail.com|Bishan|@beeshan|NS CCA|CS3242 BT3101 CS1010E CS3219 CE3165` provides information for a person with the following details:

| Field           | Value                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Name            | Bee Shan                                |
| Phone           | 81121128                                |
| Email           | beeshan@gmail.com                       |
 | Station         | Bishan                                  |
 | Telegram Handle | @beeshan                                |
 | Groups          | NS, CCA                                 |
 | Modules         | CS3242, BT3101, CS1010E, CS3219, CE3165 |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** These names were chosen so that we can easily extract more information such as Location (as coordinates) for use in future features.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: Try not to alter this data too much, as some persons (like Albert Park) are used in testing.

# **4. Design**

---

## **Architecture**

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.svg" style="width:60%;margin:0 20%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.1.1</b> Architecture Diagram for the high-level design of the App
</div>
<br>


### **Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


### **How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.1.2</b> Sequence Diagram for the command <code>delete 1</code>
</div>
<br>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers1.svg" style="width:70%;margin:0 15%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.1.3</b> Class Diagram for Component Managers
</div>
<br>

The sections below give more details of each component.

---

## **UI Component**

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.2.1</b> Class Diagram for UI Controllers
</div>
<br>

<img src="images/UiComponentClassDiagram.svg" style="width:90%;margin:0 5%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.2.2</b> Class Diagram for UI Components
</div>
<br>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `UserProfilePanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework.

To start making changes to the UI:

- The layout of these UI parts can be found in matching `.fxml` files in the [`src/main/resources/view`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view) folder.
- The controller classes of these UI parts can be found in matching `.java` files in the [`src/main/java/seedu/address/ui`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui) folder.
- The stylesheets for these UI parts can be found in `Extensions.css` and `MainWindow.css`, except `UserProfilePanel` and `HelpWindow` with separate CSS files in matching `.css` files in the [`src/main/resources/view`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view) folder.
- For example, the layout of `UserProfilePanel` is specified in [`UserProfilePanel.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/UserProfilePanel.fxml), with controller class at [`UserProfilePanel.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UserProfilePanel.java) and stylesheet at [`UserProfilePanel.css`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/UserProfilePanel.css).


The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.

## **Key Mapping**

<img src="images/KeyMapActivityDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.3.1</b> Activity Diagram for UP and DOWN keys
</div>

<br>
The UP and DOWN keys have been mapped to return previously typed commands by the user.<br> <br>
The above activity diagram does not include the mapping of the UP and DOWN keys to return previously typed commands by the user in order to avoid excessive complexity and maintain clarity. It is important to note that when the user has pre-existing text in the input field or has made edits to previous commands, the UP and DOWN keys will function as expected to prevent accidental deletion of user input.

---

## **Model Component**

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.1</b> Class Diagram for Model Components
</div>
<br>

The `Model` component,

* stores the information of the user's contacts i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the command history i.e., all command strings (which are contained in a `ArrayList<String>` object).
* maintains a _filtered_ and _sorted_ list of currently selected persons, which can be accessed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`. This list is observable, allowing for easy UI integration with automatic updates when data changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components. This means that it can function independently and make sense on its own, without relying on other components.

### **Person**

**API** : [`Person.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java)

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.2</b> Class Diagram for Person Components
</div>

#### **Name**

Represents the name of the user or the contact in EduMate.

#### **Station**

Represents the nearest MRT station to the user or contact's home.

#### **Phone**

Represents the contact number of the user or the contact.

#### **Email**

Represents the Email Address of the user or contact.

#### **Telegram Handle**

Represents the Telegram Handle of the user or contact.

#### **Group Tag Set**

Represents a collection of **unique** groups that the user or contact belong to. This class was created to support easy sorting by the group field.

#### **Module Tag Set**

Represents a collection of **unique** modules that the user or contact is enrolled into. It contains the lessons that the person has, as well as the modules shared with the user. This class was created to support easy sorting by the module field.

### **Tag**

The following tags are used for adding important pieces of information to the person.

#### **Group Tag**

A group tag represents the relationship between the user and the person. For example, the person may be tagged with the "CCA" tag to indicate that the user and the person are CCA mates.

#### **Module Tag**

A module tag represents a module that the person is currently taking. There are two options for creating a module tag:

* The user can tag a person with just the module code (`CFG1002`). This is typically used for modules that don't have lessons. In other words, this format simply informs EduMate that the person is taking the module, so that the `sort` and `find` commands can use this information.
* The user can tag a person with the module code and a lesson information (`CS2103T MON 8 10`). This will create a lesson on Monday from 8AM to 10AM, and informs EduMate that the person is busy during this time period. This is used by the `meet` command to recommend meet up timings.

### **Time**

We use `org.joda.time.LocalTime` as the very basis of how we construct our time-related
objects which is then used elsewhere in the codebase.

<img src="images/TimeGroup.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.3</b> Class Diagram for classes in Time Package
</div>

#### **Day**

`Day` is an enumeration class in Java and it only contains the 5 weekdays: `MONDAY`,
`TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`.

#### **HourBlock**

`HourBlock` is an object which represents an hour of time.

#### **TimeBlock**
`TimeBlock` is an object which can represent any positive hour of time.

#### **TimePeriod**
`TimePeriod` is the parent class of both `HourBlock` and `TimeBlock`. Hence, we often use `TimePeriod` when passing arguments around.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Notice that `TimePeriod` is an abstract class and hence cannot be instantiated. Instead, we create a new `TimeBlock`, since it achieves the same functionality as the `TimePeriod`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** The time period is prefixed using `T/` (rather than `t/` which is used by the telegram handle). It follows the format `T/START_TIME END_TIME`, and along with the day, it creates a new time period.

</div>

### **Location**

A `Location` represents a point in Singapore. We use them to recommend places for the user to meet up with friends. It consists of a latitude (how far north it is), and a longitude (how far east it is).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Restrictions on location attributes:**<br>

* Latitude: must be between *1.23776* and *1.47066*
* Longitude: must be between *103.61751* and *104.04360*

This is to ensure that the location falls within the bounds of Singapore.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:heavy_check_mark: **The location can be *named* or *unnamed*:**<br>

* *Named locations* are meant for actual locations in Singapore. For example, we may have "Bishan", "NUS", and "Suntec City".
* *Unnamed locations* are reserved for computational purposes. For example, a location in between "Bishan" and "Ang Mo Kio" may be used to recommend suitable meet up locations.

</div>

There are also two other classes within the `location` package that help to process this data.

#### Distance Util

The `DistanceUtil` class deals with computing the distances between locations. It is used by the following classes:

* It is used by the [Recommenders](#recommenders) to suggest ideal and central locations for people to meet.
* It is used by the [LocationTrackers](#location-tracker) to give us approximate locations for a person.

#### Location Data Util

The `LocationDataUtil` class deals with reading and parsing location data from files. For example, the set of destinations to eat and study are stored in the [resources/data](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/data) folder and are saved within this class. We also store the locations of MRT stations, which allow us to convert user-inputted strings into named locations.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tips for using Locations:** Notice that locations are immutable. This allows us to pass around locations as references, thereby reducing the amount of data we need to store.

</div>

### **Commitment**

A `Commitment` is something that a person needs to do at a certain time and place. Notice that we can only create `Lesson`s at the moment. Having this as a separate class can allow us to easily extend this application to fit more kinds of commitments.

<img src="images/CommitmentClassDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.4</b> Class Diagram for Commitment Components
</div>
<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **What are commitments used for:** <br>

* They tell us when the person is unavailable, so that we do not recommend inappropriate timings.
* They tell us where the person is expected to be at a particular time, so that we can recommend better locations to meet up.

</div>

#### **Lesson**

`Lesson` is inherited from `Commitment`, and represents a time and location that a person is attending a class. In addition, `Lesson` stores the module code for the lesson. For example, a person takes CS2040S on Monday at 9AM for 2 hours.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-dark">

:construction: **Potential extensions:**<br>
Currently, all `Lessons` are in NUS, but this can be improved upon in the future, by adding additional arguments to the `tag` command.

</div>

### **Timetable**

The `Timetable` represents the daily schedule of the user or contact.

<img src="images/TimetableClass.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.5</b> Class Diagram for Timetable and related classes
</div>

<br>
For each `Day` in the `Timetable`, there are 15 `HourBlock` objects each representing an hour starting from 8 AM - 9 AM and ending at 10 PM - 11 PM.

### **Utils**

#### **Sample Data Util**

The `SampleDataUtil` class deals with reading and parsing persons data from a file. In particular, these are the people that will appear upon first load of EduMate, as well as during the execution of `SampleCommand`. The sample data is stored within [this file](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/sampleData.txt).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tips for reading the sample data:**<br>

* Each row of data corresponds to a single person, and their fields are separated by the `|`, also known as the "pipe" character.
* The attributes are: `NAME|PHONE|EMAIL|ADDRESS|TELEGRAM_HANDLE|GROUP_TAGS|MODULE_TAGS`.
* Notice that the `MODULE_TAGS` are separated by a comma `,` instead, as its parser uses spaces to separate out the arguments.

</div>

## **Logic Component**

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.5.1</b> Class Diagram for Logic Components
</div>
<br>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `EduMateParser` class to parse the user command.
2. If needed, a command-specific parser (like `AddCommandParser`) will be called to parse the arguments of the user input.
3. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g. `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

## **Commands**

#### **Add Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddCommandParser.java)

The `add` command allows users to create a new person and insert them into the application.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types an input, the parser will extract out the relevant arguments and [check whether they are valid](#model-component).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Format:** <br>

* `add n/NAME [p/PHONE] [s/STATION] [e/EMAIL] [t/TELEGRAM] [g/GROUP]... [m/MODULE]...`: Adds a contact to EduMate.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The arguments for `AddCommand` are unordered, so the user can type them in any order. They are all handled in [Argument Multimap](#argument-multimap).

</div>

**Computing the common modules** - One of our sort keys is to use the *number of common modules* that the person has with the user. As such, we cache these modules to optimise performance.

**Assigning a Contact Index** - After the inputs have been parsed and extracted, EduMate will look to fill the *first* gap in contact index. i.e. it will find the **lowest positive integer** that isn't already the contact index of a person. Refer to the example given below:

| Current state of EduMate           | New Contact Index | Explanation                                                 |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Gwon Se Rang<br/>2. Lao Ming Da |         3         | 3 is the next number in the sequence.                       |
| 1. Gwon Se Rang<br/>3. Lao Ming Da |         2         | 2 is the lowest number that is not already a contact index. |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** The User has the default `ContactIndex` of 0.
</div>

In summary, the activity diagram is as such:

#### **Edit Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EditCommandParser.java)

The `edit` command allows the user to edit an existing contact in EduMate.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types an input, the parser will extract out the relevant arguments and [check whether they are valid](#model-component).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `edit z/FIELD`: Edits the user details.

* `edit INDEX z/FIELD`: Edits the details of the contact at the specified `INDEX`.

</div>

**Distinguishing between contact and user** - As specified in the command formats, if the user wants to edit their own details, they can just leave out the index. On our end, the `ArgumentMultimap` has been modified to accept null as a valid index, which will handle such a use case.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Similar to [`AddCommand`](#add-command), the arguments for `EditCommand` are unordered.

</div>

**Computing the common modules** - One of our sort keys is to use the *number of common modules* that the person has with the user. As such, we cache these modules to optimise performance.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** When editing a contact, we only need to update the common modules for **that person**. However, when editing the user, we need to update common modules for **every person** in EduMate.

</div>

**Creating a person descriptor** - When we are editing a person, we need two things:

* The edited details: These are specified by the user as arguments in the `edit` command.
* The person's original details: If the user does not specify to edit a particular field, we take the *current* data stored in the field.

From these two sources of information, we can create a `descriptor` that keeps track of what the new person *should* be, which gives us lines such as:

* `editPersonDescriptor.getName().orElse(userToEdit.getName())`.


In summary, the activity diagram is as such:

#### **Tag Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/TagCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TagCommandParser.java)

The `tag` command allows user to add `ModuleTag`s or `GroupTag`s to an existing contact in EduMate.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types in an input, the parser will extract out the relevant arguments.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `tag m/MODULE...`: Tags modules to the user.

* `tag INDEX m/MODULE...`: Tags modules to the contact at the specified index.

* `tag m/MODULE DAY START END...`: Tags lessons to the user with the specified parameters, and tags the module if not already done so.

* `tag g/GROUP...`: Tags groups to the user.

* `tag INDEX g/GROUP...`: Tags groups to the contact at the specified index.

</div>

**Distinguishing between contact and user** - As specified in the command formats, if the user wants to edit their own details, they can just leave out the index. On our end, the `ArgumentMultimap` has been modified to accept null as a valid index, which will handle such a use case.

#### **Untag Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UntagCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/UntagCommandParser.java)

Similar to the `tag` command, the `untag` command allows user to remove `ModuleTag`s and `GroupTag`s from an existing contact in EduMate.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types in an input, the parser will extract out the relevant arguments.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `untag m/MODULE...`: Untags modules from the user.

* `untag INDEX m/MODULE...`: Untags modules from the contact at the specified index.

* `untag m/MODULE DAY START END...`: Untags lessons from the user with the specified parameters, and untags the module if it is empty.

* `untag g/GROUP...`: Untags groups from the user.

* `untag INDEX g/GROUP...`: Untags groups from the contact at the specified index.

#### **View Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ViewCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ViewCommandParser.java)

The `view` command allows users to view their information or their contact's information on the Profile Panel on the lower right side of the application, above the Command Box. A single `view` command defaults to displaying the profile of the user. On the other hand, we can display
a contact's information appending their assigned `ContactIndex` or by adding `n/FULL_NAME` behind the `view` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** The last viewed profile will remain displayed on the Profile Panel should there be any exceptions thrown during the parsing process.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `view` : Displays user's profile on the Profile Panel.

* `view n/XYZ` : Display XYZ's profile on the Profile Panel.

* `view INDEX` : Display the contact's whose `ContactIndex` is `INDEX` on the Profile Panel.

</div>

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user enters the input, the `ViewCommandParser` will first check if the arguments are empty.
- If it is not empty, then `ViewCommandParser` will try to extract tokens that were prefixed `n/` (for the name).
- If a name is not present in the arguments, it will search for an index (of `int` type) instead in the preamble. <br>

    The parser, using the arguments (if they exist), creates the `ViewCommand` to be executed.

Below is a Sequence Diagram which summarises the behaviour of `ViewCommandParser`.

#### **Find Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/FindCommandParser.java)

The `find` command allows users to search for their contacts with partial information.

For example, if the user wants to search for a person but does not know the full name, they can simply search the name and get a list of people matching the name. This applies to all information a Person contains. Additionally, it can accept multiple keywords for the search but is limited to the same type of information.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types an input, the parser will extract out the relevant arguments and check if there is only one type of information.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `find [z/FIELD MORE_FIELD]`: Finds the contacts matching the field found in the 'z' field.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

* This command can be used before the other commands to return a list of contacts the user wants to work with.

* The `find` command returns a filtered list, so command operations only work on persons present in the filtered list.<br>
  e.g. If the filtered list does not contain any person with contact index 2, any operation relating to contact index 2 will throw error.

</div>

**Describing the find** - `ContainsKeywordPredicate` class which extends from `Predicate` handles storing the `Prefix` and `keywords` to pass into the `ModelManager` class. It then uses the Java `FilteredList` Library to handle the `Predicate` to return a list of people the user requested.

In summary, the activity diagram is as such:

#### **Sort Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SortCommandParser.java)

The `sort` command allows users to arrange their contacts in the order they desire. To be more robust in their arrangement, users are allowed to chain comparators together to break ties.

For example, if the user wants to sort by groups, and break ties with name, they can simply type `sort g/ n/`.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types an input, the parser will *scan* through the arguments. Then, it checks whether the field needs to be sorted in **ascending** or **descending** order. Finally, it combines all the comparators together so that we get a single comparator.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `sort`: Sorts the contacts by their `ContactIndex`.

* `sort [z/a]...`: Sorts the contacts by the `z` field in **ascending** order.

* `sort [z/d]...`: Sorts the contacts by the `z` field in **descending** order.

* `sort [z/]...`: Sorts the contacts by the `z` field in their **default** order.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Unlike the other commands, the ordering of the arguments **does matter**. For example, `sort g/d n/a` is different from `sort n/a g/d`.

</div>

**Describing the sort** - The `Comparator` class in Java does not have a `toString()` method. As such, we have to pass a descriptor when we are creating our `SortCommand`. Additionally, we needed a mapping from the prefixes (`n/`) to their descriptors (`Name`). As such, we transformed the `Prefix` class to an `Enum` to easily get the descriptors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip**: JavaFX works with `ObservableList` to populate the UI components. However, we can wrap this `ObservableList` inside a `SortedList` which accepts a `Comparator` as an argument. In this way, we only need to set this argument if we want to sort something in the UI.

</div>

#### **List Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ListCommand.java)

The `list` command will allow users to view all the contacts saved in EduMate.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Format:** <br>

* `list`: lists all contacts in the EduMate Application.

</div>

#### **Exit Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ExitCommand.java)

The `exit` command allows users to exit the EduMate Application via the command line.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Format:** <br>

* `exit`: Exits the EduMate Application.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** Sets the `isExit` boolean in the `ExitCommandResult` class to `true` which is passed through multiple classes to the `MainWindow` class to handle the exit.

The `save` command allows users to save a copy of EduMate. This information is stored within the `data` folder, the same place as where `edumate.json` is kept.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Saving the Json file:**<br>
We cannot save the json file directly from the command, because the command only has access to the model. Instead, we pass the file path through a `SaveCommandResult`, which will inform the `LogicManager` to save the information in a particular file.

#### **Meet Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/MeetCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/MeetCommandParser.java)

The `meet` command allows users to get recommendations of optimal meeting timings and locations with their contacts.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Sub-Commands:** <br>
The `meet` command has 2 different sub-commands : `eat`, `study`.
However, we will be referring to all 3 commands generally as `meet`.
</div>

All 3 commands (`meet`, `study` and `eat`) only differ in the location
recommendations as certain locations are only appropriate for certain activities.

Running `meet` will recommend studying, eating locations and other general locations together with their recommended timings.

This feature is utilises the [`Recommender`](#recommenders).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `meet CONTACT_INDEX...`: Recommends a meeting time and location for all the participants with the given contact indices (including the user).

* `eat CONTACT_INDEX...` : Recommends a time and eating place where all participants with the given contact indices (including the user) can have a meal together.

* `study CONTACT_INDEX...` : Recommends a time and study spot where all participants with the given contact indices (including the user) can study together.

</div>


#### **Organise Command**
Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/OrganiseCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/OrganiseCommandParser.java)

The `organise` command will set a meet up with the time and place for all participants and the user himself/herself. Note that the user's information is automatically added to the list of participants as it is assumed that they will be taking part in the meet up.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:** <br>

* `organise RECOMMENDATION_INDEX` : Takes the recommendation at the specified index and saves it.
* `organise CONTACT_INDEX... d/DAY T/START_TIME END_TIME l/LOCATION` : Creates a new meet up for participants with the given contact indices. Note that this list of contact indices should not include that of the user (0).

</div>

On the other hand, the `unorganise` command will remove the meet up at the specified index.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Format:**<br>

* `unorganise MEET_UP_INDEX`: Removes the scheduled meet up with the specified index.

</div>

The [`TimingRecommender`](#timing-recommender) will check if the timing is a suitable for every participant to meet.

#### **Sample Command**
Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SampleCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SampleCommandParser.java)

The `sample` command repopulates the EduMate with a fresh set of contacts. Note that this calls the same function as that called in [Sample Data Util](#sample-data-util).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Format:**<br>

* `sample NUMBER` : Replaces the EduMate with the specified `NUMBER` of sample persons.

</div>

## **Parsers**

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.5.12</b> Class Diagram for Parser Components
</div>
<br>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EduMateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g. `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `EduMateParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser` etc.) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible (e.g. during testing).

#### **Argument Multimap**

The `ArgumentMultimap` utilises a `HashMap` to store an `ArrayList<String>` of arguments from the user, mapped to the `Prefix` that precedes the arguments.

#### **Prefix**

The `Prefix` is an `enum` consisting of `n/` ,`s/`, `p/`, `t/`, `e/`, `g/`, `m/`, `d/`, `T/`, `l/` and a blank `Prefix` which is an empty String. The Prefixes listed previously correspond to [Name](#name), [Station](#station), [Phone](#phone), [Telegram Handle](#telegram-handle), [Email](#email), [Group Tags](#group-tag), [Module Tags](#module-tag), [Day](#day), [Time Period](#timeperiod) and [Location](#location).

## **Recommenders**

**API** : [`Recommender.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/recommender/Recommender.java)

<img src="images/RecommenderClassDiagram.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.5.13</b> Class Diagram for Recommender Module
</div>
<br>

The `Recommender` component,
* consists of 2 sub-components (modules) : `LocationRecommender` and `TimingRecommender`
* recommends timing and location of meet ups for relevant participants and the user.

How the `Recommender` Component works:
1. User enters a `meet/eat/study` command.
2. The `TimingRecommender` is initialised with a set of participants.
3. The `LocationRecommender` is initialised with a set of destinations.
4. New `LocationTracker`s are created to give approximate locations of each person.
5. The `TimingRecommender` recommends common available timings amongst users and participants.
6. Based on the timings provided, the `LocationTracker`s return each person's approximate locations.
7. The `LocationRecommender` recommends optimal meeting points based on the locations provided by the `LocationTracker`s.
8. Feedbacks to user the recommended meet up locations and timings.

<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.5.14</b> Sequence Diagram for Recommender Module
</div>
<br>

#### Timing Recommender
The `TimingRecommender`'s role is to recommend timings in which the user and all participants are available.
The `TimingRecommender` uses the participants' schedule to find common time periods that everyone
will be free so that a meet up could be scheduled.

<img src="images/SchedulerActivity.svg" style="width:60%;margin:0 20%">
<div style="width:60%;margin:0 20%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.5.15</b> Activity Diagram for <code>TimingRecommender</code>
</div>
<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">


:information_source: **Very important re-emphasis:** The `TimingRecommender` will always recommend timeslots and **ranks them in descending time** duration that
the participants could meet up.
</div>

#### Location Recommender

The `LocationRecommender`'s role is to recommend a **central location** where persons can meet. It accepts two sets of locations:
1. A set of `destinations` to be suggested. They could be places to study, eat or both.
2. A set of `sources` representing the participants' locations given a particular time.

The midpoint of these `sources` is calculated, and then we compare the `destinations` based on how close they are to this midpoint. In this way, we recommend the locations that are the closest for everybody.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info:** As part of abstraction, most of the logic is handled by the `DistanceUtil` class, which calculates distances and finds the nearest destinations.

</div>

#### Location Tracker

The `LocationTracker`'s role is to give an approximate location of a person given a certain timing. These approximations are then fed into the `LocationRecommender` to give more accurate recommendations.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **How we approximate a location:** A person is assumed to be travelling gradually between known locations. For example, if the person is in NUS at 9AM and at home at 11AM, they are assumed to be somewhere in the middle at 10AM.

</div>

The process of getting a recommendation is as follows:
1. From the person's timetable, we gather their set of **known locations**. For example, if the person has a lesson at NUS on Monday 8AM to 9AM, we know their location at that time period.
2. Next, between any two **consecutive known locations**, we calculate the number of unknown locations between them.
3. Based on this calculation, the `DistanceUtil` will return a list of approximations that achieve what was mentioned earlier.
4. Finally, these locations are put in their respective places in the `LocationTracker`.

## **Storage Component**

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.svg" style="width:100%;margin:0 0%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.6.1</b> Class Diagram for Storage Components
</div>
<br>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, command history in text format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EduMateStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

---

## **Common Classes**

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### **MathUtil**

The `MathUtil` class contains generic functions for mathematical operations such as Cartesian Product and indexing.

# **5. Testing**

---

## **Testing Types**

Types of tests used:
* Developer Testing
* Regression Testing
* Unit Tests
* Stubs
* Integration testing
* Dogfooding

Our organisation made use of different testing types in order to cover multiple grounds. Types of testings also changed 
with the progress of the product.

### **Developer Testing**

Our organisation opted to use developer testing right from the start with every increment of the product, instead of 
waiting for the whole product to be ready before conducting more tests.

This type of testing involved the developers trying out the product with the various commands implemented, to 
discover possible bugs early, and avoid major reworks in future increments and iterations.

### **Regression Testing**

Our organisation continued with regression testing as increments came in, to ensure that previous features were not 
broken with changes and modifications. This is due to the interconnectedness of certain features implemented, such as 
commands and the model. Our project followed a breadth-first iterative model, and hence it was crucial for us to carry 
out regression testing as the project evolved and morphed. 

Our organisation did this both with automated unit tests and manual testing. 
We put a greater emphasis on unit tests due to the expensive cost of manual testing, especially at stages of the product 
where it is not complete in its entirety.

### **Unit Tests**

Our organisation primarily utilised `JUnit5` for conducting unit tests. `JUnit5` is a popular testing framework in the Java programming language that enables developers to write and run unit tests for their code.

Each individual unit of the program is tested to ensure each piece works correctly and stubs are commonly used to test the units in isolation.

Unit tests were implemented as features were added in, to ensure that as the product evolves, these features will have tests to ensure 
that they are still working as intended. Unit tests were also changed and added on as the product progressed, to ensure
that the features were tested more thoroughly as the team learned new testing types and techniques.


### **Stubs**

Stubs were used to test features and classes in isolation, so that any bugs in dependencies will not affect the tests
that are in place. Use of stubs is common in our testing for models, as they have a lot of dependencies
that make it difficult to test the entire logic in total. The model stubs are in use when testing other classes like commands. 
Stubs help to isolate dependencies so that each component's logic are tested without being affected by other components.

### **Integration Testing**

Integration testing was used extensively in the testing of the GUI, as part of CI. Integration testing were also 
included in unit tests to ensure that our features work well with each other. It was also covered manually via developer
testing and dogfooding.


### **Dogfooding**

Towards the completion of our product, our developers used the product on a regular basis in an attempt to simulate how 
a normal user might use the product. This helped ensure that our product would be relatively bug-free for a regular use
case.

## **Model**

Our organisation created dummy values for a model of a simulated list of persons that our product might, and used that
to carry out testing on. When changes were made to the model in the product, any changes required were reflected in 
this testing model as well, to ensure that unit tests are testing on a correct simulation of the program.

## **Testing Commands**

Our organisation tested commands by creating commands with the correct parameters, bypassing the parser, and executed 
them. Assertions were used to ensure that commands created, when executed, performed the correct operations on the model
created specifically for tests, as well as to ensure that correct exceptions are thrown as and when needed, especially for
invalid inputs.

Our organisation made use of equivalence partitions to tests for the types of commands that can be executed. The rationale
is that since we have a relatively large number of variants for each command, we needed to test all possible inputs and 
partitions.

## **Testing Parsers**

Our organisation opted to use stubs in order to test the parsers, to isolate that the parser is firstly parsing the 
correct text, and returning the correct corresponding command. 

Negative and positive test cases were used to ensure that invalid inputs throws the correct exceptions, and that valid 
inputs creates and returns the correct command with correct parameters. This testing ensures that our definitions for 
equivalent commands were well-defined.

## **GUI Tests**
Our organisation utilised `TestFX` for conducting GUI tests. `TestFX` is a popular testing framework for `JavaFX` applications as it provides a set of tools and utilities for writing tests that interact with `JavaFX` UI components, simulate user interactions, and perform assertions on the state of the UI.

We referenced from [Addressbook Level 4 (AB4)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4) on automated GUI testing. 
* What's different from AB4:
  * We used the Github Actions Workflow located in `.github/workflows/gradle.yml` rather than setting up `Travis CI` as per `TestFX` [documentation](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX#continuous-integration-ci).
  * `build.gradle` runs both unit tests and GUI tests in the same task, which is also used by `Github Actions workflow`.
  * `TestFX` version is upgraded to `4.0.16-alpha` while `openjfx-monocle` version is upgraded to `jdk-12.0.1+2`.

### **Setting up automated GUI Tests in Github Actions**
Due to the Github Actions environment, there is a need to test in a headless environment. To test in a headless environment, you must add `Monocle` as a test dependency as per [TestFX documentation](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX#continuous-integration-ci).

The current [build.gradle](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/build.gradle) sets the GUI tests to run in a headless environment by default. To remove that or set it to run with visual output on your local computer, find the code block below and set the `jvmArgs` and `systemProperties` according to your needs.
```groovy
test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
    finalizedBy jacocoTestReport
    jvmArgs "-Dheadless=${project.hasProperty('headless') 
            ? project.headless 
            : false}"
    systemProperties = [
            'testfx.robot': 'glass',
            'testfx.headless': 'true',
            'prism.order': 'sw',
            'prism.text': 't2k',
    ]
}
```

### **Understanding GUI Tests**
We utilised GUI tests from [AB4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/tree/master/src/test/java) and here is a summary of it.

<img src="images/UiTestClassDiagram.svg" style="width:70%;margin:0 15%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 5.1.1</b> Class Diagram for UI Tests
</div>
<br>

Note that `AllUITests` above refers to all UI Tests in `seedu.address.ui` except for `TestFxmlObject`. The handles used in the corresponding test cases can be easily seen from their names. For example, `CommandBoxTest` contains `CommandBoxHandle`.
<br>

<img src="images/NodeHandleClassDiagram.svg" style="width:70%;margin:0 15%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 5.1.2</b> Class Diagram for Node Handle

<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 5.1.3</b> Class Diagram for Stage Handle
</div>
<br>

All UI tests using `TestFX` extend from `GuiUnitTest` and handles are created for the corresponding UI test, which extends from either `StageHandle` or `NodeHandle` depending on the type used for `UiPart` in the actual class to be tested.

# **7. Appendix**

## **Planned Enhancements**

1. To handle cases where the module code provided is not a valid NUS module, we propose the use of the NUSMods API to check whether the module exists. In this way, we can also tag the lessons with a more specific venue to improve recommendation of locations within NUS. This is currently not implemented as EduMate is an offline application, and existing modules will change overtime.


2. Apart from lessons, people may have commitments outside of NUS. To handle these cases, we propose to modify the `tag` command to take in a time and location to indicate that a person will be at the location at that time. This is currently not implemented as it is considered a new feature.


3. To better create automated fields, we propose the use of `Optional` in our person fields. They would show "Unknown" if the field is not there, making it clearer that the fields have not been populated yet. This is currently not implemented as it would require major changes to the commands, as well as storage.


4. The profile panel currently overspills when there are too many modules and groups. This can be solved in the future by converting the profile panel into a scroll pane, thereby allowing longer panels to be shown. This, however, requires us to refactor our UI components, which is not allowed at this phase.


5. Despite us not allowing it, the application still can enter full screen mode due to the settings on certain devices. This is unintended behaviour, as we intended EduMate to remain at a fixed size. One possible solution would be to re-enable the resizing of the application. However, this would require major changes to the UI, making it more responsive to such resizing events.


6. More explicit feedback messages for `tag` and `untag` commands for users.

## **Project Requirements**
