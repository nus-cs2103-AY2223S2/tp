### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/careflow/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/careflow/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`CareFlowLogic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`CareFlowModel`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`CareFlowStorage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `p delete -i 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `CareFLowLogic` component defines its API in the `CareFlowLogic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `CareFlowLogicManager.java` class which follows the `CareFlowLogic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/careflow/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PaientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/careflow/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `CareFlowLogic` component.
* listens for changes to `CareFlowModel` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `CareFlowLogic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `CareFlowLogic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `CareFlowModel` component, as it displays `Patient` object residing in the `CareFlowModel`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`CareFlowLogic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/careflow/logic/CareFlowLogic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `CareFlowLogic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `CareFlowLogic` component works:
1. When `CareFlowLogic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CareFlowParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `CareFlowLogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `CareFlowModel` when it is executed (e.g. to add a patient).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `CareFlowLogic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `CareFlowLogic` component for the `execute("p delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `CareFlowLogic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CareFlowParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CareFlowParser` returns as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/careflow/model/CareFlowModel.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `Model` component,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `PatientRecord` that represents a list of patients.
* stores a `DrugInventory` that represents a list of drugs.
* stores a `HospitalRecord` that represents a list of hospitals.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `CareFlowModel` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


<img src="images/PatientModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `PatientRecord` stores a list of `Patient` objects, which each:
* stores details of a patient: `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `DateOfBirth`, `Gender` and `Ic` .
* `DrugAllergy` might left blank if the patient does not have drug allergy.
* Each patient may have two associated phone numbers: a required phone number, which is the patient's own phone number, and an optional phone number, which is the phone number of the patient's emergency contact.


<img src="images/DrugModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `DrugInventory` stores a list of `Patient` objects, which each:
* stores details of a drug: `TradeName`, `ActiveIngredient`, `Direction`, `Purpose`, `SideEffect` and `StorageCount`.


<img src="images/HospitalModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `HospitalRecord` stores a list of `Hospital` objects, which each:
* stores the Hospital information: `Name` and `Phone` which is the hotline of the hospital.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**The hospital data is predefined and not editable by users, as it is hard-coded in our system<br>
</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/careflow/storage/CareFlowStorage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both patient and drug data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
  * inherits from both `PatientRecordStorage`, `DrugInventoryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of the three(if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.careflow.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Pie chart drug storage analysis feature

The pie chart displayed as part of the user interface relies on drug inventory data from `CareFlowLogic`, passed to the `DrugPieChartPanel` constructor as an `ObservableList`

This is the sequence of component interactions that sets up data for the pie chart upon program initialisation.
![PieChartSequenceDiagram](images/PieChartSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage sequence of steps taken by the user that triggers visual updates to the drug storage analysis pie chart, displaying the latest storage percentage calculations:

**Step 1.** The user launches CareFlow for the first time. Since no Drugs are stored yet, dummy Drug inventory data will be loaded.

**Step 2.** The user adds a new Drug by executing the command `d add`.

**Step 3.** The user updates the quantity of the added Drug by executing the command `d update`.

**Step 4.** The user deletes the previously added Drug by executing the command `d delete`.

### Find drug by trade name feature

Users may use the `d find TRADENAME` command to retrieve information about a drug.

This is the sequence diagram illustrating how different components interact to execute a `find` command from the user.
![drugFindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DrugFindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

**Step 1.** The user enters the `"d find Panadol"` command. This causes the listener attached to the command box to fire, and the event handler function `handleCommandEntered()` is triggered.

**Step 2.** The `handleCommandEntered()` function invokes the `CommandExecutor#execute` method, which in turn calls the   `CareFlowLogicManager#execute` method, delegating command execution to the `Logic` component.

**Step 3.** The `CareFlowLogicManager#execute` method promotes `CareFlowParser` to parse the command, which then recursively calls the `parse` method of `DrugParser` and `FindCommandParser` to parse the command step by step.

**Step 4.** The `FindCommandParser` creates a new `TradeNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance using the keyword `"Panadol"` and passes this instance, `predicate` to the `FindCommand` constructor. It then returns the `findCommand` instance back to `DrugParser` and `CareFlowParser`, eventually reaching `CareFlowLogicManager`.

**Step 5.** Upon receiving this `findCommand` instance, `CareFlowLogicManager` goes on to invokes its `FindCommand#execute` method, passing the `CareFlowModelManager` instance as the method argument

**Step 6.** The `FindCommand#execute` method uses `CareFlowModelManager#updateFilteredDrugList` to filter the current list of drugs using the `predicate` set earlier.

**Step 7.** The `FilteredDrugList` now only contains drugs whose trade name contains the keyword `"Panadol"`.

**Step 8.** Upon completion of command execution, a message feedback is packaged in the `commandResult` instance and passed to the `CommandExecutor`.

**Step 9.** The `CommandExecutor` then displays the message feedback and update UI to display the filtered list of drugs.

   1.  Currently the only way for the user to view the hospital detail is by clicking on the hospital tab using a mouse.
       We recognize that we have overlooked the need for a keyboard-only command to view hospital details, and we will
       make sure to include a h view command as an essential feature in our upcoming implementation.

2. Command to switch from patient records to drug inventory or hospital hotlines and vice versa.

   1.  We considered this as a good-to-have feature because we already have a `p view` and `d view` command for user
       to look at patient and drug record respectively, so user still able to view patient and drug record without
       having a mouse.

3. Allow more than one patient to have same name

   1.  Currently our system don't allow patient to have the same name. In future implementation we might consider
       to allow patient to have duplicate name and identify them using NRIC or FIN.

4. Detecting unusual user input value for phone number

   1.  Need to work on phone number validation, i.e: when user input only special character for phone data field,
       ex: ()+-, then the system wouldn't able to detect this. In future implementation, we consider to restrict
       user to input telephone numbers only for this data field.
