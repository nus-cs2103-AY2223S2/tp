## **FastTrack**

FastTrack is an easy-to-use financial management desktop application designed for NUS SoC undergraduate students who are living on a tight budget. With a combination of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI), our app provides a user-friendly and efficient way to track your expenses and manage your finances.

---

## **Purpose of this guide**

The purpose of this guide is to give you a comprehensive insight for developing and maintaining FastTrack.

If you are a developer, this guide will give you an overview of the high-level [design](#design) and architecture of FastTrack. It also delves into the [implementation](#implementation) and design considerations of FastTrack features, allowing you to learn the ins and outs of FastTrack in no time. If you are lost now, you can start by first looking at the [set-up](#setting-up-getting-started) portion.

If you like to know more about the motivation behind FastTrack, checkout the [requirements](#appendix-requirements) section where we cover the [product scope](#product-scope) as well as the [user stories](#user-stories) and [use cases](#use-cases).

### Architecture

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given below explains the high-level design of the FastTrack and how each component is connected.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="500" />

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fasttrack/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fasttrack/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

FastTrack also consists of five other components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`AnalyticModel`**](#analyticmodel-component): Holds the data and outputs statistics based on the data in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.


<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />


Each of the 5 main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

This component is responsible for displaying and interacting with users of FastTrack through the GUI.

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fasttrack/ui/Ui.java)


<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="1200" />


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of the following parts.

- `CategoryListPanel`
  - `CategoryCard`
- `ExpenseListPanel`
  - `ExpenseCard`
- `RecurringExpensePanel`
  - `RecurringExpenseCard`
- `StatisticsPanel`
- `CommandBox`
  - `SuggestionListPanel`
    - `SuggestionCard`
- `ResultDisplay`
  - `ResultsHeader`
  - `ResultsDetails`

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fasttrack/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component, to help guide you along on how it works:


<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>


#### **How the `Logic` component works:**

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ExpenseTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses' subclass e.g., `AddCategoryCommand`, which implements `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a category).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delcat 1")` API call.


![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:


<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>


#### **How the parsing works:**

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `ExpenseTrackerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCategoryParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCategoryCommand`) which the `ExpenseTrackerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCategoryParser`, `DeleteCategoryParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fasttrack/model/Model.java)


<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Model` component,

- contains the expense tracker data i.e., all `Category` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCategoryList` object), which is pulled from the `ReadOnlyExpenseTracker` instance.
- contains the currently 'selected' `Category` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Category>` that can be
  'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- contains the expense tracker data i.e., all `Expense` objects (which are contained in a `ExpenseList` object), which is pulled from the `ReadOnlyExpenseTracker` instance.
- contains the currently 'selected' `Expense` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>` that can be
  'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- does not depend on any of the other four components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### AnalyticModel component

**API** : [`AnalyticModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fasttrack/model/AnalyticModel.java)


The `AnalyticModel` component,

- contains the expense tracker data (i.e. all `Expense` and `Category` objects, which are respectively contained in `ExpenseList` and `UniqueCategoryList` objects), which are pulled from the `ReadOnlyExpenseTracker` instance.
- calculates statistics based on the expense tracker data available.
- listens to any changes made to expense tracker data (by attaching listeners to the `ExpenseList`), thus dynamically updating statistics.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/fasttrack/storage/Storage.java)


<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="900" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both expense tracker data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from `ExpenseTrackerStorage`
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Add Expense feature

#### **Command Format**

`add n/EXPENSE_NAME c/CATEGORY_NAME p/PRICE [d/DATE]`, whereby the date is an optional field.

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `add` command enables users to add an `Expense` to the `ExpenseTracker`.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `add` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `add n/Milk p/4.50 c/Groceries` as an example.

1. The user inputs `add n/Milk p/4.50 c/Groceries` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `AddExpenseCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. `AddExpenseCommand#execute()` is called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model` and adds the `Expense` used to instantiate the `AddExpenseCommand` through the `Model#addExpense()` method, which adds the new `Expense` object to the list of current `Expense` objects. Note that if the newly instantiated `Expense` has a `Category` that does not match any existing `Category` objects, the `Expense` object's `Category` will be added to the `ExpenseTracker` as a new `Category`.

4. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback that the `Expense` was successfully logged.

:information_source: **Note**:

- For step 2, if the user does not have any arguments, the `AddExpenseCommand` object will NOT be created!

A sequence diagram is provided as follows, which matches the list of steps mentioned above:


<img src="images/sequence_diagrams/AddExpenseSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />


### \[Implemented\] Delete Expense feature

#### **Command Format**

`delete INDEX`

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `delete` command enables users to delete an `Expense` from the `ExpenseTracker`.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `delete` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `delete 1` as an example.

1. The user inputs `delete 1` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `DeleteExpenseCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. `DeleteExpenseCommand#execute()` is called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, retrieves the `Expense` object at the specified `INDEX`, and deletes it from the underlying list of `Expense` objects of the `Model` instance using `Model#deleteExpense()`.

4. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback that the `Expense` was successfully deleted.

:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if input is detected as invalid, an error will be shown on the screen and the sequence of action is terminated.

A sequence diagram is provided as follows, which matches the list of steps mentioned above:


<img src="images/sequence_diagrams/DeleteExpenseSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />


### \[Implemented\] Edit Expense feature

#### **Command Format**

`edexp INDEX [c/CATEGORY_NAME] [n/EXPENSE_NAME] [p/PRICE] [d/DATE]`, whereby all fields except the `INDEX` field are optional, BUT at least one of the optional fields
must be used (Otherwise, there is no purpose for calling this command).

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `edexp` command enables users to edit an `Expense` in the `ExpenseTracker`.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `edexp` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `edexp 1 n/Chicken` as an example, whereby the original `Expense` object has a `EXPENSE_NAME` of `Milk`.

1. The user inputs `edexp 1 n/Chicken` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `EditExpenseCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. The `LogicManager#execute()` function causes `EditExpenseCommand#execute()` to be called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, retrieves the `Expense` object at the specified `INDEX` from the `FilteredList<Expense>` of the `Model` instance, and instantiates a new `Expense` object that has the same fields as the retrieved `Expense` object except for the `EXPENSE_NAME`. Note that if the newly instantiated `Expense` has a `Category` that does not match any existing `Category` objects, the `Expense` object's `Category` will NOT be added to the `ExpenseTracker` as a new `Category`, and an error indicating that no such `CATEGORY_NAME` exists will pop up.

4. The newly-instantiated `Expense` object with the updated `EXPENSE_NAME`, namely `Chicken`, will then replace the retrieved `Expense` object at the specified `INDEX` in the `ExpenseList` using `Model#setExpense()`.

5. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback that the `Expense` was successfully edited.

:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if the input is detected as invalid (either index is invalid or no arguments provided other than index), a matching error will be shown on the screen and the sequence of action is terminated.
- At step 3, if the user provides a category to edit to, and it is found that there is no such category in FastTrack, an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.

A sequence diagram is provided as follows, which matches the list of steps mentioned above:


<img src="images/sequence_diagrams/EditExpenseSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />


<img src="images/sequence_diagrams/EditExpenseFindPartSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />


### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: How the expense is edited**:

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Retrieve the specified `Expense`, instantiate a new `Expense` with specified edited fields, and replace the retrieved `Expense` in the `ExpenseList`.

  - Pros: As the UI implementation requires listening in on the `ObservableList<Expense>`, replacing the previous `Expense` object with a new `Expense` object makes the live-refreshing of our UI much more intuitive.
  - Cons: There is an additional `Expense` object being instantiated to replace the previous `Expense` object.

- **Alternative 2:** Retrieve the specified `Expense` and use setter methods to set the specified fields to be edited.
  - Pros: No additional `Expense` object needs to be instantiated, and it is easier to simply set the fields.
  - Cons: The listeners for the `ObservableList<Expense>` only detect when there is an actual operation being done on the list, therefore setting fields will not cause the listeners to be updated, making our UI implementation much more complicated.

### \[Implemented\] List feature

#### **Command Format**

`list [c/CATEGORY_NAME] [t/TIMEFRAME]`, whereby both `CATEGORY_NAME` and `TIMEFRAME` are optional.

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `list` command enables users to view all expenses within the expense tracker, and even allows them to view the expenses affiliated with a certain category or timeframe, or a combination of both.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `list` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `list c/Groceries t/week` as an example.

1. The user inputs `list c/Groceries t/week` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `ListExpensesCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. The `LogicManager#execute()` function causes `ListExpensesCommand#execute()` to be called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, and applies the `ExpenseInCategoryPredicate` and `ExpenseInTimespanPredicate` sequentially onto the `Model` object's `FilteredList<Expense>` by `Model#updateFilteredExpensesList()`.

4. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback of how many `Expenses` are currently listed under the current filters.

:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if an invalid input is detected after `list` (e.g. `list xxxxxx`), an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.

A sequence diagram is provided as follows, which matches the list of steps mentioned above:


<img src="images/sequence_diagrams/ListExpensesSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />


### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Whether to make `ListExpensesCommand` have multiple constructors or to make it take in `ExpenseInCategoryPredicate` and `ExpenseInTimespanPredicate` as `Optional` objects.**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `ListExpensesCommand` takes in `Optional<ExpenseInCategoryPredicate>` and `Optional<ExpenseInTimespanPredicate`

  - Pros: Makes for cleaner code, and allows for less clutter in terms of using multiple constructors.
  - Cons: Usage of multiple constructors could have been easier to understand in terms of what the idea is.

- **Alternative 2:** `ListExpensesCommand` has multiple constructors to differentiate the different possible cases of user input for filters.
  - Pros: Easier to understand, and all differentiation is done at the parsing stage.
  - Cons: Much more cluttered and code will not be as clean.

### \[Implemented\] Add RecurringExpenseManager feature

#### **Command Format**

`addrec n/EXPENSE_NAME c/CATEGORY_NAME p/PRICE sd/START_DATE t/FREQUENCY [ed/END_DATE]`, whereby only `END_DATE` is an optional field.

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `addrec` command enables users to add recurring expenses within the expense tracker, which will automatically generate expenses based on the provided `FREQUENCY`.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `addrec` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `addrec n/Broth c/Groceries p/3 sd/06/04/23 t/week` as an example.

1. The user inputs `addrec n/Broth c/Groceries p/3 sd/06/04/23 t/week` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `AddRecurringExpenseCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. `AddRecurringExpenseCommand#execute()` is called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, and adds the previously instantiated `RecurringExpenseManager` to the `Model` object's current list of `RecurringExpenseManager` objects. Note that if the newly instantiated `RecurringExpenseManager` has a `Category` that does not match any existing `Category` objects, the `RecurringExpenseManager` object's `Category` will be added to the `ExpenseTracker` as a new `Category`.

4. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback of the `RecurringExpenseManager` object being successfully added.

:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if any input is detected as missing or invalid, an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.
- At the completion of step 3, due to the behavior of `RecurringExpenseManager`, expenses will be retroactively added if the start date up till current date (or end date if end date is earlier) sufficiently spans the timeframe frequency.

An activity diagram is provided as follows, which matches and further elaborates on the list of steps mentioned above:


<img src="images/activity_diagrams/addRecurringExpenseActivityDiagram.png" width="1800" />

### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Whether `Expense` objects should be retroactively added for `RecurringExpenseManager` objects that have `START_DATE` in the past.**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `Expense` objects are retroactively added.

  - Pros: Allows users to easily add recurring expenses, even if they are in the past.
  - Cons: If the user keys in the wrong `START_DATE`, they will need to take some time to manually remove all retroactively created `Expense` objects.

- **Alternative 2:** `Expense` objects should not be retroactively added.
  - Pros: Wrong input for the `START_DATE` will not cause a flood of retroactively created `Expense` objects to be added.
  - Cons: Users might not want to take the time to accurately add the `Expense` objects in the past, which goes against our group's aim.

### \[Implemented\] Delete RecurringExpenseManager feature

#### **Command Format**

`delrec INDEX`

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `delrec` command enables users to delete a `RecurringExpenseManager` from the `ExpenseTracker`.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `delrec` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `delrec 1` as an example.

1. The user inputs `delrec 1` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `AddRecurringExpenseCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. `DeleteRecurringExpenseCommand#execute()` is called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, retrieves the `RecurringExpenseManager` object at the specified `INDEX`, and deletes it from the underlying list of `RecurringExpenseManager` objects of the `Model` instance using `Model#deleteRecurringExpense()`.

4. The `RecurringExpenseManager` object, after being added to the list of other current `RecurringExpenseManager` objects, will retroactively add in `Expense` objects if the `START_DATE` and `FREQUENCY` make sense to do so. (e.g. The `START_DATE` is 03/02/2023, and the `FREQUENCY` is weekly, then, however many `Expense` objects will be generated up-to-date to try and help the user track recurring expenses accurately.)

5. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback that the `RecurringExpenseManager` object was successfully deleted.

:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if the index is detected as invalid or missing, an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.

An activity diagram is provided as follows, which matches and further elaborates on the list of steps mentioned above:


<img src="images/activity_diagrams/deleteRecurringExpenseActivityDiagram.png" width="1800" />


### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Whether expenses generated by the `RecurringExpenseManager` object should also be deleted.**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `Expense` objects generated by the `RecurringExpenseManager` object are NOT deleted upon the deletion of the `RecurringExpenseManager` object itself.

  - Pros: Makes more intuitive sense when a `RecurringExpenseManager` expires or is terminated by the user, past `Expense` objects should still remain as they have already been spent and allows for accurate tracking.
  - Cons: If user unintentionally keys in wrong information for the `RecurringExpenseManager` that is irreversible in terms of generating `Expense` objects, it could end up taking a while for them to manually delete the `Expense` objects.

- **Alternative 2:** `Expense` objects generated by the `RecurringExpenseManager` object are deleted upon the deletion of the `RecurringExpenseManager` object itself.
  - Pros: If user unintentionally keys in wrong information for the `RecurringExpenseManager` that is generally irreversible in terms of generating `Expense` objects, it is easily undone by simply deleting the `RecurringExpenseManager` object.
  - Cons: Users will not be able to accurately track past spendings as expired `RecurringExpenseManager` objects will delete affiliated `Expense` objects.

### \[Implemented\] Edit RecurringExpenseManager feature

#### **Command Format**

`edrec INDEX [n/EXPENSE_NAME] [c/CATEGORY_NAME] [p/PRICE] [t/FREQUENCY] [ed/END_DATE]`, whereby all fields except for `INDEX` are optional, but at least one
of them must be specified (Otherwise, there is no point in editing).

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `edrec` command enables users to edit a `RecurringExpenseManager` in the `ExpenseTracker`.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `edrec` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `edrec 1 n/Coconut Milk` as an example.

1. The user inputs `edrec 1 n/Coconut Milk` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `AddRecurringExpenseCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. `EditRecurringExpenseManagerCommand#execute()` is called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, retrieves the `RecurringExpenseManager` object at the specified `INDEX` from the `FilteredList<RecurringExpenseManager>` of the `Model` instance, and sets the `EXPENSE_NAME` field of the `RecurringExpenseManager` object found at the given `INDEX` to be `Coconut Milk`.

4. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback that the `RecurringExpenseManager` object was successfully edited.

:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if the index provided is detected as invalid or if no arguments other than index are provided, an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.
- At step 3, if the user provides a category to edit to, and it is found that there is no such category in FastTrack, an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.

An activity diagram is provided as follows, which matches and further elaborates on the list of steps mentioned above:


<img src="images/activity_diagrams/editRecurringExpenseActivityDiagram.png" width="1800" />


### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Whether the `RecurringExpenseManager` object should be replaced instead of having its fields set.**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Retrieve the specified `RecurringExpenseManager` and use setter methods to set the specified fields to be edited.

  - Pros: Easy to simply retrieve the `RecurringExpenseManager` object and use setter for the fields.
  - Cons: If any future developments require close listening to the `ObservableList<RecurringExpenseManager>` to be displayed in the UI, some refactoring might need to be done.

- **Alternative 2:** Retrieve the specified `RecurringExpenseManager`, instantiate a new `RecurringExpenseManager` with specified edited fields, and replace the retrieved `RecurringExpenseManager` in the underlying `RecurringExpenseList`.
  - Pros: Future developments which rely on the `ObservableList<RecurringExpenseManager` will be able to be smoothly implemented, as there are list operations being carried out by replacing objects.
  - Cons: Extra layers of code required to instantiate a new `RecurringExpenseManager` object to replace the original.

### \[Implemented\] List RecurringExpenseManager feature

#### **Command Format**

`lrec`.

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `lrec` command enables users to view all `RecurringExpenseManager` objects within the expense tracker.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `lrec` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `lrec` as an example.

1. The user inputs `lrec` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `ListRecurringExpensesCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. The `LogicManager#execute()` function causes `ListRecurringExpensesCommand#execute()` to be called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, and calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()` with `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EXPENSES`.

4. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback of how many `RecurringExpenseManager` objects are present in the expense tracker, as well as switching to a screen of the list of `RecurringExpenseManager` objects.

A sequence diagram is provided as follows, which matches the list of steps mentioned above:

<img src="images/sequence_diagrams/ListRecurringExpensesSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />


### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Whether to make `ListExpensesCommand` have multiple constructors or to make it take in `ExpenseInCategoryPredicate` and `ExpenseInTimespanPredicate` as `Optional` objects.**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `ListExpensesCommand` takes in `Optional<ExpenseInCategoryPredicate>` and `Optional<ExpenseInTimespanPredicate`

  - Pros: Makes for cleaner code, and allows for less clutter in terms of using multiple constructors.
  - Cons: Usage of multiple constructors could have been easier to understand in terms of what the idea is.

- **Alternative 2:** `ListExpensesCommand` has multiple constructors to differentiate the different possible cases of user input for filters.
  - Pros: Easier to understand, and all differentiation is done at the parsing stage.
  - Cons: Much more cluttered and code will not be as clean.

### \[Implemented\] Add Category feature

#### **Command format:**

`addcat c/NAME [s/SUMMARY]` where `NAME` is the new category name and an optional `SUMMARY` of the category.

#### **What is the feature about:**

This command allows the user to add a new category to FastTrack. If the new category has the same name as an existing category in the database, the command will not be executed.

#### **Sequence of actions:**

1. The user enters `addcat c/food s/expense on food` in the command box.<br><br>
2. The input is then [parsed](#how-the-parsing-works) and a `AddCategoryCommand` object is created with the new `Category` object. <br><br>
3. `AddCategoryCommand#execute()` is called, which will trigger the model to add a category.<br><br>
4. `Model#addCategory()` is called, which further calls `ExpenseTracker#addCategory()`. <br><br>
5. `UniqueCategoryList#add()` is called to add the new category to FastTrack.<br><br>
6. A `CommandResult` is returned.<br><br>

:information_source: **Note:**

- At step 3, if the new category has the same name as an existing category, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the sequence of action will be terminated.

As the sequence diagram for this feature is highly similar in idea to that of the [add expense feature](#implemented-add-expense-feature) except for a difference in certain method names, there will be no sequence diagram provided.

### \[Implemented\] Delete Category feature

#### **Command format:**

`delcat INDEX` where `INDEX` refers to the index of the category to be deleted when `lcat` is called.

#### **What is the feature about:**

This command allows user to delete a category of choice, expenses with the deleted category will have its category replaced with the `MiscellaneousCategory`. The category will be removed from the user's database.

#### **Sequence of actions:**

1. The user enters `delcat 1` in the command box.<br><br>
2. The input is then [parsed](#how-the-parsing-works) and a `DeleteCategoryCommand` object is created using the given `INDEX`.<br><br>
3. `DeleteCategoryCommand#execute()` is called, this will retrieve the category object to be deleted from the list of categories. <br><br>
4. This will call `Model#deleteCategory()`, which will further call `ExpenseTracker#removeCategory()`.<br><br>
5. `UniqueCategoryList#remove()` is called to remove the `Category` at index 2, and `ExpenseList#replaceDeletedCategory()` is called to replace all expenses with the deleted `Category` with `MiscellaneousCategory`.<br><br>
6. A `CommandResult` object is returned.<br><br>

:information_source: **Note:**

- At step 2, if an invalid `INDEX` is given, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the sequence of action will be terminated.
- At step 3, if the `INDEX` given is out of range, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the sequence of action will be terminated.

As the sequence diagram for this feature is highly similar in idea to that of the [delete expense feature](#implemented-delete-expense-feature) except for a difference in certain method names, there will be no sequence diagram provided.

### \[Implemented\] Edit Category feature

#### **Command format:**

`edcat INDEX [c/NAME] [s/SUMMARY]` where `INDEX` refers to the index of the category to be edited when `lcat` is called, `NAME` is the new name of the category, `SUMMARY` is the new summary of the category. Note that either a `NAME` or `SUMMARY` must be present for the command to be executed.

#### **What is the feature about:**

This command allows user to edit a category of choice. We allow users to edit either the category's name, summary or both in this command.

#### **Sequence of actions:**

1. User enters `edcat 1 c/food s/expense on food` in the command box.<br><br>
2. The input is then [parsed](#how-the-parsing-works) and a `EditCategoryCommand` object is created using the given index `1`, new category name `food` and new summary `expense on food`. <br><br>
3. `EditCategoryCommand#execute()` is called. The category to edit is obtained from the `Model` and stored as `categoryToEdit`. <br><br>
4. The function checks that a new category name is present, thus it calls `UserDefinedCategory#setCategoryName()` on `categoryToEdit`, changing the name of the target category to the given new name.<br><br>
5. The function checks that a new category summary is present, thus is calls `UserDefinedCategory#setDescription()` on `categoryToEdit`, changing the summary of the target category with the given new summary.<br><br>
6. A `CommandResult` object is returned.<br><br>

:information_source: **Note:**

- At step 2, if an invalid `INDEX` is given or **both** `c/NAME` and `s/SUMMARY` is missing, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the sequence of actions will be terminated.
- At step 4, if there is a category with the same name as the new name given, a `CommandException` is thrown and the sequence of actions will be terminated.

As the sequence diagram for this feature is highly similar in idea to that of the [edit recurringexpensemanager feature](#implemented-edit-recurringexpensemanager-feature) except for a difference in certain method names, there will be no sequence diagram provided.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the category object is edited**:

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Directly retrieve and edit the currently-specified `Category` object.

  - Pros: No need to re-point all `Expense` objects currently affiliated with the `Category` object that is being edited.
  - Cons: Mutates the state of the `Category` object, which might not be ideal if seeking immutability.

- **Alternative 2 :** Retrieve the specified `Category` object's name and summary, and create a new `Category` object
  that uses the same name and summary before replacing the required name or summary depending on user's arguments.
  - Pros: Enforces immutability by replacing the previous `Category` object.
  - Cons: There is now a need to re-direct all `Expense` objects affiliated with the previous `Category` object of interest.

### \[Implemented\] List Category feature

#### **Command Format**

`lcat`.

#### **What is this feature for?**

The `lcat` command enables users to view all `Category` objects within the expense tracker.

### **Sequence of action**

To aid you in understanding how exactly the `lcat` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `lcat` as an example.

1. The user inputs `lcat` in the command box.

2. The input is then [parsed](#logic-component) and a `ListCategoryCommand` object is created using the given fields.

3. The `LogicManager#execute()` function causes `ListCategoryCommand#execute()` to be called, which takes in the currently-running instance of `Model`, and calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()` with `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EXPENSES`.

4. A `CommandResult` instance is then returned, with feedback of how many `Category` objects are present in the expense tracker, as well as switching the screen to that of a list of the `Category` objects.


A sequence diagram is provided as follows, which matches the list of steps mentioned above:

<img src="images/sequence_diagrams/ListCategorySequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

### **\[Implemented\] Recurring Expense feature:**

#### **What is the feature about:**

Since recurring expenses are prominent in today's society (e.g. Netflix, Transportation), therefore having a feature to allows FastTrack to regularly add recurring expenses automatically is a must.

To implement this feature, 3 classes were added:

1. [`RecurringExpenseManager`](#the-recurringexpensemanager-class)
2. [`RecurringExpenseList`](#the-recurringexpenselist-class)
3. [`RecurringExpenseType`](#the-recurringexpensetype-class)

##### **The `RecurringExpenseManager` class:**

The `RecurringExpenseManager` class is used as a generator of recurring expenses. When a user wants to add a recurring expense in FastTrack, the user can use the `addrec` command to create a new `RecurringExpenseManager` object. This object will have the following fields:

- `expenseName` - Name of the recurring expense.
- `amount` - Unit price of the recurring expense.
- `category` - The category of the recurring expense.
- `startDate` - The date to start adding the recurring expenses.
- `[endDate]` - An optional ending date of the recurring expense.
- `nextExpenseDate` - The next date to charge the recurring expense.
- `recurringExpenseType` - The interval to charge the recurring expense (day, week, month, year).

##### **The `RecurringExpenseList` class:**

The `RecurringExpenseList` class works similar to the `ExpenseList` and `UniqueCategoryList` classes where is stores all the `RecurringExpenseManager` object created by the user.

##### **The `RecurringExpenseType` class:**

This is an enum class that stores the valid intervals (day, week, month, year) for a recurring expense. It also contains the `RecurringExpenseType#getNextExpenseDate()` method that calculates the next date given the interval and target date.

#### **Sequence of actions:**

Below is the sequence diagram when a user opens FastTrack:

<img src="images/RecurringExpenseStartUpSequenceDiagram.png" width="650">

Pre-requisite: The user has added some `RecurringExpenseManager` into FastTrack and all `RecurringExpenseManager` objects have their `nextExpenseDate` updated.

1. When the user reopens FastTrack, `Mainapp` will instantiate a new `Model` and `ExpenseTracker` object with the saved data. This will call `ExpenseTracker#resetData()`. <br><br>
2. `ExpenseTracker#generateRetroactiveExpenses()` is then called, this method goes through the user's `RecurringExpenseList` and calls the `RecurringExpenseManager#getExpenses()` method on each object. <br><br>
3. If the `nextExpenseDate` of the `RecurringExpenseManager` object is equal or before today's date, a new expense based on the parameters in the `RecurringExpenseManager` object will be added to a list until `nextExpenseDate` is after today's date or `endDate` if specified. The list is returned to the `ExpenseTracker`.<br><br>
4. The `ExpenseTracker` will then add each of the expenses in the returned list to FastTrack.

#### **Design considerations:**

##### Aspect: Making `RecurringExpenseManager` a class:

- **Alternative 1:** Have a `RecurringExpenseManager` extend from `Expense`. Consist of another list of recurring expenses generated by the RecurringExpenseManager.
  - Pros: Addition of 1 class only. Works similar to an `Expense` object with just an addition list to store the recurring expenses.
  - Cons: Methods for adding a new recurring expense is longer as we need to traverse the entire expense list to locate the `RecurringExpenseManager` and add to the back of the list. Furthermore, the deletion of the `RecurringExpenseManager` also removes the existing recurring expenses. <br><br>
- **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Abstract `RecurringExpenseManager` to its own class, similar to category.
  - Pros: Able to easily locate all `RecurringExpenseManager` objects that the user created, making addition of recurring expenses into FastTrack simpler and quicker. Deletion of the `RecurringExpenseManager` does not delete existing recurring expenses.
  - Cons: Requires the addition of another `RecurringExpenseList` class to store all `RecurringExpenseManager` objects. Tedious to maintain and implement.

**Alternative 2** was chosen as it would be more ideal to abide by the _Separation of Concerns_ principle. This allows proper separation of the generator class `RecurringExpenseManager` and the `Expense` class.

### **\[Implemented\] Budget feature:**

#### **Command format:**

`set p/AMOUNT` where `AMOUNT` refers to the monthly budget amount.

#### **What is the feature about:**

This feature allows users to add a monthly budget to FastTrack. A weekly budget will be calculated for users by taking `AMOUNT` / 4. The `Budget` class is meant to be coupled with `AnalyticModel` to allow users to view helpful [statistics](#implemented-expense-statistics-feature) such as remaining budget etc.

#### **Sequence of actions:**

Below is the sequence diagram when a user uses the `set` command:

<img src="images/SetBudgetSequenceDiagram.png" width="600"/>

1. User enters `set p/1000` in the command box.<br><br>
2. The input is then [parsed](#how-the-parsing-works) and a `SetBudgetCommand` object is created with a `Budget` object with an amount of `1000`.<br><br>
3. `SetBudgetCommand#execute()` is called, this will further call `Model#setBudget()` and `ExpenseTracker#setBudget()`. This will set the observable `simpleBudget` in `ExpenseTracker` to the given new `Budget`. <br><br>
4. A `CommandResult` object is returned.<br><br>

:information_source: **Note:**

- At step 2, if an invalid amount is given, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the sequence of action will be terminated.

#### **Design considerations:**

##### Aspect: Making `Budget` a class:

- **Alternative 1:** Make budget a field with `Double` type in `ExpenseTracker` rather than creating a new class.
  - Pros: Easier to implement as there is no need for a creation of a class.
  - Cons: Budget related calculations have to be done within the `ExpenseTracker` class, adding clutter. Modifications to the budget will also be more tedious as we have to locate these methods within `ExpenseTracker`.<br><br>
- **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Make a new `Budget` class.
  - Pros: Abstract all budget related operations to a class to maintain clean code. Modifications to budget related operations are also easier.
  - Cons: Less convenient as it requires the creation of a new class.

**Alternative 2** was chosen as it abides to the separation of concerns principle. This is to achieve better modularity and readability of the code base.

### \[Implemented\] Expense Statistics Feature

#### **What is the feature about:**

FastTrack allows the user to view a summary of their expense statistics for both the current week and month.
These statistics are displayed on the expense summary screen on the right window of the application and are updated automatically everytime the user adds, edits or deletes an expense from FastTrack.

The following statistics are calculated and displayed to the user. In FastTrack, the user is allowed to set only a monthly budget. A weekly budget is then defined as the value of the monthly budget divided by four (weeks).

1. `Weekly Spending` - Total amount spent for the current week
2. `Monthly Spending` - Total amount spent for the current month
3. `Weekly Remaining` - Amount of weekly budget remaining for the current week
4. `Monthly Remaining` - Amount of monthly budget remaining for the current month
5. `Weekly % Change` - Percentage increase/decrease of weekly spending relative to the previous week
6. `Monthly % Change` - Percentage increase/decrease of monthly spending relative to the previous month
7. `Total Spent` - The total amount the user has spent to-date
8. `Budget Utilised` - The percentage of monthly budget that the user has utilised this month

#### Implementation Details

The current implementation of the expense summary feature requires consistent calculations of the user's expense statistics. As such, an `AnalyticModelManager`, which implements the `AnalyticModel` interface is used to keep track of all of these statistics.
It contains fields which keep track of each individual statistic as mentioned in the above list, as well as specific methods to perform new calculations and updates to each of these fields.


`AnalyticModelManager` requires an instance of `ExpenseTracker` to read and obtain the following unmodifiable, `ObservableList` objects containing data from FastTrack:

1. `allExpenses`: an `ObservableList` of Expense objects representing all expenses in the expense tracker
2. `allCategories`: an `ObservableList` of Category objects representing all expense categories in the expense tracker
3. `simpleBudget`: a `ObjectProperty<Budget>` object representing the monthly budget of the user.

The fields contained within `AnalyticModelManager` are of type `DoubleProperty` which implement the `Observable` interface. This allows the `UI` to establish bindings to each property.
A binding is a mechanism of JavaFX allows for the establishment of relationships between variables. The `UI` observes each `DoubleProperty` for changes, and then updates the GUI automatically when it detects that the `DoubleProperty` has changed.

Each `DoubleProperty` is updated using the respective calculation method, e.g. `AnalyticModelManager#getWeeklySpent()` for the `weeklySpent` property. A listener listens for changes in the `ObservableList` objects, `allExpenses` and `allCategories`.
Each time a change is detected, for example, when the user has deleted an expense or changed the amount of an expense, for each expense statistic, its corresponding calculation method is called, causing the corresponding property to be updated. This notifies the `UI` to update and display the new calculated expense statistics on the GUI.

This method of implementation closely follows the _Observer Pattern_, which promotes loose coupling between the `UI` and the `AnalyticModelManager`. Bindings can also be added or removed dynamically, making any changes to the expense summary statistics more flexible and adaptable.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Separation of Analytics and App Data**:

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Create two separate `ModelManager` components, one for managing analytics and another for managing app data.
  - Pros: As analytics functions are read-only and do not require modifying the internal data of FastTrack, keeping the expense summary statistics in a separate component is ideal as it abides by the _Separation of Concerns_ principle.
  - Cons: Less convenient to implement as a new class would be created.
- **Alternative 2 :** Store fields and methods for calculating expense summary statistics inside the existing `ModelManager` component.
  - Pros: Easier to implement as the class already exists, there is no need to instantiate another `AnalyticModelManager` class.
    - Cons: Will result in the current `ModelManager` being cluttered due to the presence of many differing getter and setter methods. Violates the _Separation of Concerns_ principle since the process of calculating statistics does not involve modifying the data within FastTrack, i.e. is purely read-only.

**Alternative 1** was chosen as it would be more ideal to abide by the principle of _Separation of Concerns_. Moreover, as many developers were working on features that require direct modification of the `ModelManager` component, separating analytics into another `AnalyticModelManager` eliminates the possibility of merge conflicts.

**Aspect: GUI update when user updates expenses in FastTrack**:

- **Alternative 1:** Call methods to calculate and refresh the summary statistics after every user command.
  - Pros: More convenient to implement since it is easy to ensure the GUI is always updated whenever the user enters a command
  - Cons: Inefficient, as this would require tearing down and creating a new instance of each `UI` component in order to display the updated data. Redundant calculations would also need to be performed every single time the user enters a command that does not change the underlying expense data.
- **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Use the _Observer Pattern_ to allow `UI` to update whenever the underlying data of FastTrack changes
  - Pros: More efficient, since no redundant calculations are performed. The `AnalyticModelManager` also does not need a reference to the `UI` component to perform an update, which reduces the coupling between these classes.
  - Cons: Was more time-consuming to implement, due to the need to learn about mechanisms like bindings and change listeners in JavaFX.

**Alternative 2** was chosen as it was neater to implement and performs statistic calculations only when absolutely necessary, this preventing unnecessary wastage of computational resources.

### \[Implemented\] Category Autocomplete feature

The category autocompletion feature in FastTrack is implemented using two `UI` classes, namely the `SuggestionListPanel` and the `CommandBox`.

The `SuggestionListPanel` is a JavaFX `UI` component responsible for displaying the suggestion list for the category autocomplete feature. It receives two parameters in its constructor, namely an `ObservableList<Category>` and a `CommandBox`.
The `ObservableList<Category>` contains all available categories in FastTrack, and the `CommandBox` is the `UI` component that contains a text field which allows users to enter commands, as well as for setting text to autofill.

To filter the categories based on the user's input, the `SuggestionListPanel` makes use of a `FilteredList<Category>`. This filtered list is used as the data source for the `ListView` `UI` component of the `SuggestionListPanel`.
The `FilteredList<Category>` displays filtered categories based on whether the category name matches the user's input.

Upon initialization, the `SuggestionListPanel` sets up autocomplete handlers for the suggestion list by calling the `SuggestionListPanel#initialiseAutocompleteHandlers()` method. This method registers listeners for focus changes, key presses, and autocomplete filters, which work together to ensure the autocomplete feature works responsively.

When the user enters a command, they can trigger the autocomplete feature by typing `c/` followed by a few characters. These characters can then be used to filter the categories, and the most likely suggestions are displayed in the suggestion list.
To load the filter for autocompletion, the `SuggestionListPanel#loadAutocompleteFilter()` method within `SuggestionListPanel#initialiseAutocompleteHandlers()` sets up a listener for changes in the text field of the `CommandBox`.
If the user types `c/` to start entering a category name, the `SuggestionListPanel#getAutocompleteSuggestions()` method is called to retrieve the most likely suggestions based on the user's input so far.
This method filters the categories based on the user's input and updates the filtered categories as the items in the `ListView` `UI` component of the `SuggestionListPanel`.

When the suggestion list is visible, the user can navigate through the suggestions using the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys.

The `CommandBox#initialiseAutocompleteHandler()` method adds a key press event filter to the command text field that listens for the `UP` arrow key.

When the user presses the `UP` arrow key, the focus is given to the `SuggestionListPanel` if it is visible (i.e. the user had typed in `c/`), and the `SuggestionListPanel#selectLastItemOnFocus()` method selects the last item in the suggestion list by default. When the user presses the `DOWN` arrow key, the `SuggestionListPanel#handleDownArrowKey()` method is called to check if the user is about to navigate out of the suggestion list and is responsible for returning the focus back to the `CommandBox`.

To select a category from the suggestion list, the user can either navigate through the list using the arrow keys and press the `ENTER` key or press the `TAB` key to select the bottom-most suggestion in the list.
When the user makes a selection using the `ENTER` key, a callback function within the `SuggestionListPanel#addKeyPressListener()` method is called. This function updates the suggested text in the `CommandBox` by calling the `SuggestionListPanel#updateSuggestedText()` method, which sets the text in the `CommandBox` and subsequently hides the suggestion list.

If the user makes the selection by pressing the `TAB` key, the `CommandBox#initialiseAutocompleteHandler()` method simulates a `UP` arrow key press followed by an `ENTER` key press, which also causes the first suggestion in the list to be selected.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the autocomplete feature should be implemented**:

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Add the autocomplete logic within the `SuggestionListPanel` and `CommandBox` classes itself

  - Pros: This design is more convenient and allows the methods within each class to focus specifically on their own behaviors, without explicit knowledge of the autocomplete feature.
  - Cons: Currently, the `SuggestionListPanel` is tightly coupled to the `CommandBox` through its constructor parameters. This means that more modifications would need to be made if a new text input component was introduced.

- **Alternative 2 :** Create a new `AutocompleteLogic` class which uses the _Observer Pattern_ to listen to and propagate changes across the `SuggestionListPanel` and `CommandBox` components.
  - Pros: Enforces loose coupling by the _Observer Pattern_
  - Cons: Tedious to implement, and the added flexibility might be unnecessary since the autocomplete feature is not likely to be further extended upon.

2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 expenses without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. FastTrack should be designed in a modular, scalable manner to enable easy addition of new features in the future.
5. The code should be well-organized and well-documented to ensure ease of maintenance and debugging.
6. FastTrack should protect user data from unauthorized access or modification.
7. Any modification to the data will result in a prompt update to the user interface.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample expenses and categories. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
      Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. In the case whereby your data files end up corrupted, FastTrack will wipe all data and allow you to start over
      with a clean slate.


## Planned Enhancements
1. The current function of setting a budget does not properly take into account the occasion whereby the user actually wants to set a 0-dollar budget, and thus our team has opted to use a 0-dollar budget to be defined as the state of not having set a budget.
We plan to make 0-dollars no longer the state of the user not setting a budget, and instead, use another proper indicator to show that a user has not set his or her budget.

2. The current expense statistics do not make it glaringly obvious that the user's budget has been exceeded, as it is only shown in plain words without any form of 
colour-highlighting or ways to make the user notice it easily. We plan to make the indicator that one's budget has been exceeded very obvious for the user to notice by highlighting and 
bolding the text.

3. The current method of taking in dates is unable to properly distinguish a proper date with reference to that of the days 29-31 of a month. (e.g. the 31st of February is a valid input for our current state, but we force the date to be the 28th of February in our application)
We plan to properly handle this behavior for the months whereby the 29th-31st days do not exist by properly throwing an error.

4. The current colour choices in the expense statistics are possibly counter-intuitive, as we have chosen the colour red in cases whereby the user has spent more in the
current month as compared to that of the previous month to indicate negative performance, but this might confuse users as the numbers shown are +x%, whereby x is the percentage point increase in spending
as compared to the previous month. The same applies for spending lesser as compared to the previous month but in green. We are planning to make it such that the
colour choice is more intuitive (Possibly swap the colour choices around).




## Effort

The difficulty of FastTrack as a project was quite high, but one that allowed us to learn a lot. As our group lacked experience in working with
a properly-structured team as well as a pre-existing codebase that had to be overhauled for our own purposes, we had to start from scratch to learn
how exactly commands and user inputs were handled by the pre-existing AB3 codebase.

We faced numerous challenges in our journey to make FastTrack, not limited to:

1. Learning how the codebase worked and how to restructure existing code.
2. How to design the structure of FastTrack so that the `Category`, `Expense` and `RecurringExpenseManager` made sense.
3. Abstracting out certain checks into proper methods in the correct classes so as to reduce violations of principles.
4. Testing of code.

Our group reused much of what AB3 had in place, with the main bulk of reusability coming from AB3's parsing set-up and
the model as well as storage systems, which we found to be useful as they worked in quite an intuitive and robust manner after we took some
time to understand them.

However, we faced major difficulties in attempting to modify AB3 to suit FastTrack, as we realized
that AB3 primarily dealt with `Person` objects, which were only one type of entity, while we had to deal with 3 kinds of entities as
mentioned above. This led to multiple problems in our implementations and debugging stages, and we had to race against time
on multiple occasions to thankfully, successfully resolve these issues.

To sum it all up, our team did put in a significant amount of work to understand and mostly to successfully morph the existing AB3
codebase into FastTrack, and there is no doubt that we have achieved what we set out to do, and more.
