**CookHub** is a desktop application for student chefs who have limited time and resources on their hands, 
optimized for use via the Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User 
Interface (GUI).

**CookHub** is a powerful, but lightweight application that allows you to manage your recipes efficiently 
and 
effectively.

## **Purpose** ##
This Developer Guide for CookHub v1.4 serves to describe and illustrate the architecture systems used to 
design and implement the application. It contains an overall view of the system hierarchy, 
logical views of the system components, a process view of the system’s communication and reasons for 
specific design implementations. This guide is primarily intended for application developers.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, 
`RecipeListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Recipe` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CookHubParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a recipe).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CookHubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CookHubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`, `FindCommandParser`, `CookHubParser`) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* Stores the recipe book data i.e., all `Recipe` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueRecipeList` 
  object).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Recipe` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ 
  list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. 
  the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both recipe book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `RecipeBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* converts classes into their respective string formats in order to save them in json format

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.recipe.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### What is it?
The `add` command is a fundamental feature of CookHub. It allows users to easily manage add recipes to 
their recipe book.
By typing this command with the correct command flags, users can add their own recipes, which contain the title, description, steps, ingredients, and tags.

#### Usage
The `add` command format is as shown below:

`add t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION i/INGREDIENT... s/STEP... [tag/TAG]...`


The meanings of each prefix is as shown below:
- `t/` signifies the title of the recipe
- `d/` signifies the description of the recipe
- `i/` signifies the ingredient of the recipe
- `s/` signifies the step of the recipe
- `tag/` signifies the tag of the recipe

#### Implementation 
The add application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of CookHub.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid add
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates an `AddCommandParser` which has the purpose of parsing `add` commands.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `AddCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `AddCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates respective recipe components
   (i.e. title, description, steps, ingredients) by calling on `ParserUtil`.
7. `ParserUtil` creates the recipe components and returns it back to `AddCommandParser`.
8. `AddCommandParser` creates a `Recipe` instance with the recipe components as the parameters.
9. The newly created `Recipe` instance will then be used to create an `AddCommand`. This command instance
   is returned to `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `AddCommand`. 
11. `AddCommand` then calls the `addRecipe(recipe)` of `Model`.
12. An instance of `CommandResult` is returned, signifying a successful command execution.
13. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.
The sequence diagram for the `add` command is as shown below:
![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)


### Find feature

#### What is it? 
The `find` command helps users search recipes according to which component of the recipe they are looking for.

Users can find the application by using the command flags. The command flags specifies which component of a recipe you are searching through.


#### Usage 
The `find` command format is as shown below:

`find [r/RECIPE] [t/TITLE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [s/STEP] [i/INGREDIENT] [tag/TAG]`

The meaning of each prefix is as shown below:

- the flag `r/` searches through the entire recipe and its components
- the flag `t/` searches only through the recipe's title
- the flag `s/` searches only through the recipe's steps
- the flag `i/` searches only through the recipe's ingredient names
- the flag `d/` searches only through the recipe's description
- the flag `tag/` searches only through the recipe's tags

#### Implementation

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates an `FindCommandParser`.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `FindCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `FindCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates a list of keywords.
7. `FindCommandParser` will then call the respective methods responsible for parsing the predicate related to the current
command flags (i.e. `parseTitlePredicate`, `parseIngredientsPredicate`, etc.) in `ParserUtil`.
8. `ParserUtil` creates an instance of `ContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
9. `FindCommandParser` will instantiate an instance of `FindCommand` with the previously obtained predicate as the parameter.
10. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `FindCommand`.
11. The current recipe book is updated by calling `updateFilteredRecipeList(predicate)` on `Model`. 
12. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
13. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

The sequence diagram for the `find` command is as shown below:
![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)


### Only feature

#### What is it?
The `only` feature helps users gather a list of recipes that can be made with only a limited set of ingredients.

Users can type in a list of ingredients. A list of recipes that can be made with those ingredients, or less will be displayed.

#### Usage 
The `only` command format is as shown below:

`only INGREDIENT...`

#### Implementation 
1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates an `OnlyCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for finding applications.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `OnlyCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `OnlyCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates a list of keywords.
7. An instance of `RecipeIngredientsSubsetPredicate` is created.
8. An instance of`OnlyCommand()` with `RecipeIngredientsSubsetPredicate` as the parameter is created.
9. This `OnlyCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `OnlyCommand`. 
11. The current recipe book is updated by calling `updateFilteredRecipeList(predicate)` on `Model`.
12. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
13. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.
    
The sequence diagram for the `only` command is as shown below:
![OnlyCommandSequenceDiagram](images/OnlySequenceDiagram.png)

### Sort feature

#### What is it?
The `sort` command helps users sort recipes in ascending or descending order of price.


#### Usage
The `sort` command format is as shown below:

`sort ORDER`

- *ORDER* can only be `asc` or `desc`.
- `asc` is used for ascending order, and `desc` is used for descending order.
- The price of a recipe is determined by cost of all ingredients required.

#### Implementation

The following activity diagram for the `sort` command shows a high-level logic of how the logic of the sort command 
is implemented. 

The explanation for the diagram in text form is as follows:

If the order is `asc`, the recipe is sorted in ascending order of price and the sorted list is displayed 
by the UI. If the order is `desc`, the recipe is sorted in descending order of price and the sorted list is displayed
by the UI. Otherwise, a ParseException containing a message informing users that the sort order can only be `asc` or `desc`
will be displayed by the UI.

![SortCommandActivityDiagram](images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Groceries feature

#### What is it?
The `groceries` command helps users get a list of groceries needed to cook one or more recipes.


#### Usage
The `groceries` command format is as shown below:

`groceries RECIPE_NUMBER, ...`

- If two or more recipes share ingredients, their quantities will be automatically added together.
- The `RECIPE_NUMBER`s have to be separated by a comma (`,`).

#### Implementation

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates a `GroceriesCommandParser`.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `GroceriesCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `GroceriesCommandParser` then parses out the *RECIPE_NUMBERS* with the help of `ParserUtil` and creates a new `GroceriesCommand` with the
parameter of the recipe indices
7. This `GroceriesCommand` is then returned to `LogicManager`.
8. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `GroceriesCommand`.
9. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the list of groceries that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
10. Finally, the Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

![GroceriesSequenceDiagram](images/GroceriesSequenceDiagram.png)

### Filter by price feature

#### What is it?
The `fp` command helps users filter out all recipes that satisfies a certain price condition

#### Usage
The `fp` command format is as shown below:

`fp COMPARATOR PRICE`

- *COMPARATOR* can only be `<` or `>`.
- `<` is used to represent "less than"
- `>` is used to represent "more than"
- *PRICE* can take on any positive real number
- The price of a recipe is determined by cost of all ingredients required.

#### Implementation

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates an `FilterPriceCommandParser`.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `FilterPriceCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `FilterPriceCommandParser` then passes the string input to the `FilterPriceCommandParser`
via the`parseFilterPrice()` method.
7. The `ParserUtil` then parses out the *COMPARATOR* and *PRICE* and creates a new
`SatisfyPriceConditionPredicate` by passing the two arguments into its constructor.
8. The `SatisfyPriceConditionPredicate` is returned to `FilterPriceCommandParser` which creates a new `FilterPriceCommand`
by passing the predicate into its constructor.
9. This `FilterPriceCommand` is then returned to `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `FilterPriceCommand`.
11. The current recipe book is updated by calling `updateFilteredRecipeList(predicate)` on `Model`.
12. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
13. Finally, the Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

The sequence diagram for the `find` command is as shown below:

7. `ParserUtil` returns an instance of `Index`.
8. `StarCommandParser` will instantiate an instance of `StarCommand` with the previously obtained index as the parameter.
9. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `StarCommand`.
10. A copy of the recipe with the index given by the user which is set to starred is created with calling `createEditedRecipe(recipeToStar)`.
11. `StarCommand` then calls `setRecipe(recipeToStar, editedRecipe)` of `Model`.
12. The current recipe book is updated by calling `updateFilteredRecipeList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES)` on `Model`.
13. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
In the near future, we hope to be able to enhance our application as stated below.

1. Currently, after executing the `find` command, the *Filter By Price* command (`fp`) filters from the 
   **original** list of recipes. We plan to tweak the `fp` command in such a manner that it filters the 
   **subset** of recipes that have been generated after the `find` command.

2. Currently, after sorting recipes by price using the `sort` command, calling the `list` command displays 
   all the recipes in the **sorted** order. We hope to modify this in the next iteration by allowing the 
   `list` command to re-order the list to its original **unsorted** order. This is so that users will 
   still have a way to view recipes according to the time they have saved the recipe.

3. Currently, the `edit` command allows users to change a recipe title to one that already exists in 
   the recipe book but in uppercase letters (e.g. Users can change a recipe's title to `ORANGE JUICE` despite 
   another recipe having the title of `Orange Juice`). We hope to restrict this in the near future in a 
   way that uppercase letters are detected to be the same as lowercase letters (i.e. `ORANGE JUICE` = `Orange 
   Juice`).

4. Currently, the `UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT` field in the `Ingredient` class allow 
   users to input any words or sentences. We want to restrict this field to only accept valid 
   measurement units as inputs (e.g. restrict to specific strings `cup`, `tbsp`, `tsp`, `ml`, `g`, `kg` 
   using Java's Enums). This allows for error detection when user inputs a random erroneous string as a 
   unit of measurement.

5. In the future, we hope to modify all command words, flags and arguments to be **case-insensitive** to 
   mimic 
   environments in the real world.

6. We hope to enhance the `find` command such that it searches for **substrings** and not just the word itself. For instance, `find t/egg` should be able to find a recipe with the title 'eggs'.

7. Currently, our application calculates the cost of each recipe using the `PRICE_PER_UNIT` and 
   `UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT` fields. In the case when the `UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT` is a *tablespoon* for an 
   ingredient like *Olive Oil*, it will be challenging for users to estimate the price of a tablespoon of the 
   ingredient. As such, we hope to increase the intuitiveness of our application by allowing users to 
   enter an additional input of the price of such ingredients with everyday quantities (e.g. $7 for a bottle of olive oil).

8. Currently, our `find` command restricts to only **one** command flag. We hope to allow the command to 
   search through **more than one** command flag for more flexibility.

9. Currently, duplicate ingredients are allowed to be entered into a recipe. We hope to 
   modify this. In the case when a duplicate recipe is entered by the user, the result display will 
   display an error message: `You have entered a duplicate ingredient!`.

## **Appendix: Effort**
Our team has put in substantial effort into developing this application. Knowing **who** our product is 
targeted towards and determining **how** our product will meet their needs and solve their challenges are of 
utmost importance to us. As such, we have developed an extensive list of 30 [user stories](#user-stories) to 
generate the features we want to include in our application.

From then on, we had to prepare the codebase. An initial challenge we faced was understanding and refactoring the codebase which was complex and 
overwhelming. Morphing the model from `Person` to `Recipe` meant that we had to modify 
various classes and fields (e.g. changing the `email` field of the `Person` object to a `description` field 
for the `Recipe` object), and as a result, many test cases broke. However, we understood that this was part of the experience of understanding 
the codebase of AB3. As such, we devoted a significant amount of time fixing the test cases and morphing the code to follow our application's agenda.

We wanted to offer flexibility for users yet maintain a sense of structure and consistency in our 
application. Thus, a challenge was deciding on the right balance between how **rigid** we wanted to model the 
various fields of the `Recipe` object and how **flexible** user inputs can be. For instance, for the 
`Ingredient` class, we initially implemented it to simply take in an entire `String` with no check constraints. However, after 
careful deliberation and reflection on the issues that this imposed (e.g. the issue that users can input 
whatever they want into this field), we decided to structure the 
`Ingredient` field to take in a `String` that follows the format: `INGREDIENT_NAME, 
QUANTITY, UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT, PRICE_PER_UNIT`. This allowed us 
to ensure structure in our codebase by enforcing constraints on the various subfields of the `Ingredient` 
field 
(e.g. `QUANTITY` must be numeric while `INGREDIENT_NAME` must be a word or sentence).

Wanting to model a `Recipe` object in our application meant that we had to implement an extra panel to
allow users to view the details of the recipe (i.e `RecipeDetailsPanel`). With little experience in JavaFX,
this meant that we had to take the time to learn and familiarise ourselves with the library and the various
tools it offers. We also made extra effort to ensure that the UI was responsive, user-friendly and intuitive.

Overall, despite the limited time frame we had to work with to develop our product, we were able to 
prioritize the most essential features and functionalities, which allowed us to deliver a quality product. 
Not only that, we also developed a deeper understanding of the various software engineering methods, as 
well as honed our skills in areas such as brainstorming, testing and debugging.
