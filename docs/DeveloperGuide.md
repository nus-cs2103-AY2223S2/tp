### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the Coach issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

How the `Logic` component works during the user's interaction with the `Calendar`:
![Structure of the Calendar Logic](images/calendarLogic.png)


`CalendarLogic` listens to any changes in `Model`'s `filteredSessionList`, which contains different instances of `Session`, upon interaction with the `Calendar` UI.
`CalendarLogic` will then update the corresponding `Calendar` components in `Ui` that are dependent on the `CalendarEvent`.

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes Coach commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `athlete` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the Coach command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an athlete).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the 'destroy' marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a Coach command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a Coach command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the Coach command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores SportSync's data i.e., all `Person` and `Session` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueSessionList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the Coachâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `AddressBook` component, contained under `Model` is responsible for supporting the main functionalities of our app. Mainly the `Person` class facilitates that contact list functionality, while the `Session` class
facilitates the scheduling, calendar and data Analytics functionality. 


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both SportSync's data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.AddressBook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The proposed sort mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`.

Step 1. The Coach launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` is initialised.

Step 2. The Coach keys in some athletes and their details with the `add` method.

Step 3. After adding his athletes, the Coach wants to view his athletes in alphabetical order, so he wants to sort them by name in ascending order.

Step 4. The Coach then decides to execute the command `sort 1`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

Restricting attribute and order to an integer value allows for the input to be easily anticipated and controlled.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow Coaches to specify how to sort their list by integer.
    * Pros: Easier to implement in the code and faster to type by the Coach.
    * Cons: More troublesome as Coach needs to check the User Guide to learn what integers to use.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow Coaches to specify how to sort their list by words.
    * Pros: Easier to understand by the Coach.
    * Cons: Harder to implement in the code and slower to type by the Coach.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current `AddressBook` state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous `AddressBook` state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone `AddressBook` state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The Coach launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial `AddressBook` state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single `AddressBook` state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Step 2. The Coach executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th athlete in the `AddressBook`. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the `AddressBook` after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `AddressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted `AddressBook` state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The Coach executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new athlete. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified AddressBook state to be saved into the `AddressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the `AddressBook` state will not be saved into the `AddressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The Coach now decides that adding the athlete was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous `AddressBook` state, and restores the `AddressBook` to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial `AddressBook` state, then there are no previous `AddressBook` states to restore. The `undo` command uses `VersionedAddressBook#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the Coach rather
than attempting to perform the undo operation.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the 'destroy' marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the AddressBook to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `AddressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest AddressBook state, then there are no undone `AddressBook` states to restore. The `redo` command uses `VersionedAddressBook#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the Coach rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The Coach then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the AddressBook, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `AddressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The Coach executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `AddressBookStateList`, all `AddressBook` states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a Coach executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire `AddressBook`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May eventually have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the `Person` being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Session feature

#### Implementation

The proposed session feature is facilitated by a `Session`, contained in a `UniqueSessionList`, which is subsequently contained an `AddressBook`.

It supports the following sub-features:
* Adding/Removing athletes from a `Session`
* Taking the attendance of an athlete in a `Session`
* Data Analytics

To better understand how each sub-feature is implemented, we need to have a better picture of the attributes of `Session` object.

<img src="images/SessionClassDiagram.png" width="" />
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
As seen above, a `Session` needs a:
* `SessionName`: to uniquely identify a `Session`
* `Location`: extra information for the Coach
* `AttendanceMap`: to store references of participating athletes
* `PayRateMap`: to support the Data Analytics functionality

The `Session` object implements the following operations to enable the respective sub-features:

##### Adding/Removing athletes from a session
* `Session#addPersonToSession()`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a `Person` reference to a `Session` object's `AttendanceMap`.
* `Session#removePersonFromSession()`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes a `Person` reference from a `Session` object's `AttendanceMap`.

##### Taking the attendance of an athlete in a session
* `Session#markStudentPresent()`â€‰â€”â€‰ set `Person` reference in a `Session` object's `AttendanceMap` as present.
* `Session#markStudentAbsent()`â€‰â€”â€‰ set `Person` reference in a `Session` object's `AttendanceMap` as absent.


These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addPersonToSession()`, `Model#removePersonFromSession()` and `Model#setSession()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and for each sub-feature:

### Adding/Removing athletes from a session

To enable this feature, we need to have a data structure that can store references to athletes in a `Session`. A naive way to do this would be to have a `UniquePersonList` in a `Session` object. However, since we also need to track the attendance of every athlete, we propose using a `HashMap` class to store key-value pairs where the key is a `String` (the athlete's name), and the value is a `Boolean` (to indicate attendance).

<img src="images/StudentAddRemoveSequenceDiagram.png" width="" />


Step 1. The coach decides to create a new `Session` object named "Hall". A session is initialized, creating an empty `AttendanceMap`.

Step 2. The coach decides to add athlete Bob (a `Person` object) to the Hall `Session`.
1. We first find the `Name` of Bob and convert it to its `String` equivalent.
2. We then insert a key-value pair of `String`: "Bob" and `Boolean`: `false` into our `AttendanceMap`.
3. We now have a reference to athlete Bob in our `AttendanceMap` in the `Session`.
4. Note that attendance is set to `false` by default since the session hasn't started yet.

Step 3. Bob decides to quit the `Session`, and the coach decides to remove Bob from the Hall `Session`.
1. We first find the `Name` of Bob and convert it to its `String` equivalent.
2. We then check our `AttendanceMap` to make sure Bob is an existing athlete, i.e., an existing key in the `HashMap`.
3. We then remove the key of `String`: "Bob" from our `AttendanceMap`.
4. We no longer have a reference to Bob in our Hall `Session` object.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Taking Attendance of an Athlete in a Session

Similar to adding/removing athletes, marking/unmarking the attendance of an athlete relies on the `AttendanceMap` object.

<img src="images/MarkUnmarkSequenceDiagram.png" width="" />

Marking and unmarking an athlete undergo the same steps, with the only difference being that marking sets the value of the key as `true`, while unmarking sets it to `false`. Here's an example scenario where the coach decides to mark Bob as present in the Hall `Session` object:

Step 1. We check if Bob is a key in the `AttendanceMap` of Hall.

Step 2. We then set the key using the `HashMap#put()` method to set the value of the key Bob as `true`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Generating Data Analytics for a Coach

Our data analytics feature currently supports the following statistics for our coach:
1. Daily earnings
2. Weekly earnings
3. Monthly earnings
4. All-time earnings

These statistics are implemented with the help of the `PayRateMap` in the `Session` class, which maps all participating athletes with their `PayRate`. Note that `PayRate` is a float indicating the hourly rate an athlete would pay the Coach.

Since we are not storing full `Person` objects in a `Session`, we cannot find an athlete's `Payrate` by simply calling a method in the `Session` itself. The only thing stored in `AttendanceMap` is the athlete's name. Therefore, we need to access the `UniquePersonList` in the `AddressBook` class to find the `Payrate`.

The `Session` class uses the `getTotalPay()` method to find the total `Payrate` of all athletes in the `Session`. This method follows a set formula.

To find the daily, weekly, and monthly earnings, we iterate through our `UniqueSessionList` and find all instances of `Session` that fall between a specified period.

### Calendar features
The calendar feature allows a calendar to display with the corresponding `Session` instances of the month in a calendar format. The feature consists of the following features:

* `Calendar Display` - Can display appointments of a month in a calendar format.
* `Calendar Navigation` - Can navigate between months with/without a mouse.
* `Calendar Pop-Up` - Can view the details of each appointment.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Overall implementation of Calendar

The main calendar display is implemented using the `CalendarDisplay` class, which acts as the main container for the entire `Calendar` feature. This main container consists of a `topCalendar`, which is a `FlowPane` that contains the current month to be displayed, and the different navigation buttons as well as the `JumpBox`. Also, `CalendarDisplay` contains `calendarGrid`, which is a `GridPane` that contains all the dates and `Appointment` buttons within the calendar.

Upon initialisation of the `CalendarDisplay`, it will display the current month and year, using the `CalendarLogic#drawCalendar()` method. The current month and year is obtained using the default `Java` package's `GregorianCalendar` class.


**Calendar Display**

Implementation:

The following is a more detailed explanation on how `Calendar Display` is implemented:
1. When the app first launches, `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` is called, which then initialises the `Calendar Display`.
2. The `CalendarLogic` class is initialised, where the current month to be displayed in the `Calendar` is set using `Java`'s `GregorianCalendar` class.
3. Next, `CalendarLogic#drawCalendar()` is called which initialises the header of the `Calendar`, by calling `CalendarLogic#drawHeader()`, where the `FlowPane`, `topCalendar`, displays the current month.
4. Also, `CalendarLogic#drawCalendar()` will then call `CalendarLogic#drawBody()` which initialise the body of the `Calendar` and each individual day of the month is created in the `Calendar`.
5. A `CalendarEventListPanel` object is created for each day of the month, and `EventButtons` are added to each `CalendarEventListPanel` if there is an appointment falling on that particular day.
6. Following which, when appointments are added,`Model#updateCalendarEventList()` is called which then updates the `Calendar Display` as well.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Calendar Navigation**

The Calendar navigation allows a user to navigate between different months in the calendar and also navigate between the different appointments within the current month,
by clicking on the Next/Prev buttons to view the next/previous month in the calendar.


**Calendar Pop-up**

The calendar Pop-up allows user to view the details of the appointment in the calendar.

These are the ways that a user can use the `Calendar Pop-up` feature:
1. Clicking on the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to view adjacent instances of `Session` oriented in space in the calendar after selecting one `Session`
2. Clicking on a desired appointment to view the `Session` in the calendar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. **The names of the individual tag and session-related commands are inconsistent.**<br>
   For example, creating a new athlete uses `add`, while a new session uses `create-session`, and adding an athlete to a session uses `student-add`.<br>
   We plan on standardising the names to `add`, `add-session`, and `add-athlete` to avoid confusion.

2. **UI inconsistencies may not be user-friendly.**<br>
   This is especially the case when the message is long (i.e. an error message).<br>
   We plan on adjusting the app UI such that the features scale according to the size of the window, including the output box which will display its entire contents without needing to scroll through it.

3. **The app cannot be navigated solely through keyboard input alone.**<br>
   Mouse clicks are still required to select an athlete/session even after using keyboard shortcuts to switch tabs.
   This may make it inconvenient for those who may prefer CLI apps.<br>
   We plan on making the app completely navigable through keyboard input while also allowing one to click parts of the GUI.

4. **Once created, a session cannot be edited.**<br>
   This makes it inconvenient for the user when they mistakenly create a session with the wrong details.
   Hence, we plan on adding a `session-edit` command.<br>
   This will allow users to edit created sessions and not have to create new ones entirely.

5. **More error messages could be added to cover all possible invalid inputs.**<br>
   When entering a wrongly formatted command, SportSync displays a generic message stating that the command format is wrong.<br>
   We plan on adding more error messages that precisely state how the command format is wrong, to improve user understanding.<br>
   e.g. "Wrong command format: Datetime should be in format DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm"

6. **Session panel user experience could be improved.**<br>
   Currently, the sessions in the session panel need to stay selected to see their analytics.<br>
   If the user clicks the command box while a session is selected, the analytics are cleared.<br>
   We plan on making the analytics stay present at all times unless when clicking and selecting a different session so users can better reference their analytics.

8. **Help command could be more helpful.**<br>
   Help command only opens a window for users to copy a link to the User Guide.<br>
   We plan on making the help command display all possible user command formats so the user does not need to exit the app to find help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
