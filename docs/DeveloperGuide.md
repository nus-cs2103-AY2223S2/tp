### Architecture

The General Architecture of FriendlyLink follows that of [AddressBook3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html).

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_elderly S1234567G`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/developerGuide/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ElderlyListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Elderly`, `Volunteer` and `Pair` objects residing in
  the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FriendlyLinkParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPairCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a pair).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_elderly S1234567I")` API call.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteElderlyCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FriendlyLinkParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPairCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPairCommand`) which the `FriendlyLinkParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPairCommandParser`, `DeletePairCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/developerGuide/ModelDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Model` component,

* stores `FriendlyLink` data i.e., all `Elderly`, `Volunteer` and `Pair` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueElderlyList`, `UniqueVolunteerList` and `UniquePairList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Elderly`, `Volunteer` and `Pair` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Elderly>`,  `ObservableList<Volunteer>` and `ObservableList<Pair>` respectively  that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* depends on some classes in the `Storage` component (because the `Model` component requires `Storage` to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)


This is the detailed implementation of `Person` in `Model`. 
* Both `Elderly` and `Volunteer` inherit from the abstract class `Person`.
* A `Pair` makes reference to one `Elderly` and one `Volunteer` each.

<br>

<img src="images/developerGuide/PersonNew.png" width="250" />


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/developerGuide/StorageClassDiagram.png"/>

The `Storage` component,
* can save `Elderly`, `Volunteer`, `Pair` and `UserPrefs` data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `ElderlyStorage`, `VolunteerStorage`, `PairStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Storage` represents data entities on disk, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add and Delete Elderly and Volunteer

In FriendlyLink, `Elderly` and `Volunteer` are both implemented as subclasses of the abstract class `Person`.

The `add_elderly` and `add_volunteer` commands accept attributes of `Elderly` and `Volunteer` through prefixes.
Each prefix is followed by the information of one attribute.
Some prefixes, such as `availableDates`, `tags`, are optional.

* This grants greater flexibility of user input, as the user can key in the attributes in any order.
* The unspecified optional fields will return `null` value.
* The `NRIC` attribute for Elderly and Volunteer will be cross-checked to ensure no duplicates.
* When the `add` command format is invalid, or the user tries to add a duplicated person,
  the add operation will be aborted.

The Elderly and Volunteers are stored in separate `UniquePersonList` lists.

* Allows for filtering to display a subset of Elderly or Volunteers in UI.
* Allows for easy retrieval of information for pairing.

The `delete_elderly` and `delete_volunteer` commands make use of the `NRIC`
attribute of Elderly and Volunteer.
FriendlyLink retrieves the target person uniquely identified by its NRIC,
and removes it from the database.

* Allows more efficient deletion compare to index-based deletion.
* The user don't need to check the index of the target person before deletion.

If the deleted Elderly or Volunteer has existing pairings, the associated
pairs will be automatically removed as well.

### Command Recommendation and Autocompletion of Field's Prefixes

Both autocompletion and recommendation are facilitated by `CommandRecommendationEngine.java`. The Logic component registers 
individual command parsers, which implement the `Parser` interface, to enable recommendations of command inputs. Each parser,
such as `{XYZ}CommandParser`, specifies how recommendation should differ for a specific command by overriding the 
`Parser#getCommandInfo` method. When the user types a valid command, the `CommandBox` UI component detects the keystroke 
through its `KeyPressedHandler` and triggers the `CommandRecommendationEngine#generateCommandRecommendations` method. 
This method then returns the relevant recommendations. When a `KeyEvent.TAB` event is triggered, autocompletion builds 
on the method and replaces the user input with the recommended values. 

Using the longest prefix match algorithm, the engine first **identifies** the related command and then **verifies** the 
fields associated with it. If there are ambiguities in the recommendations, the recommendation will rank the commands 
using lexicographical ordering. 

In order to simplify implementation, we differentiate between two types of commands: "Full Attribute" commands and "Complete" commands. 
A "Full Attribute" command is one in which all the fields, both optional and required, have been specified. 
A "Complete" command, on the other hand, means that the command has been fully typed, but the fields may or may not
have been entered. This distinction assists the engine in giving more precise suggestions based on the user's input.

The following activity diagram describes the activity flow:

<img src="images/developerGuide/CommandRecommendationActivityDiagram.png"/>

#### Design considerations

Aspect: How recommendation executes:

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Custom recommendations for each command 
  - Requires each `{XYZ}CommandParser` to override the `Parser#getCommandInfo` method, specifying the exact behaviour on how recommendations should behave.
  - Recommendations will be more relevant to the current command, and user input can be validated against the set of possible prefixes specified in the overridden method.

**Alternative 2**: Store all possible prefixes and recommends based on user input 
  - Cannot enforce that user only inputs relevant prefixes as there is no reference as to what the "correct" prefixes are.
  - Likewise, such design is unable to recommend all relevant attributes, which can greatly reduce the user experience. 

### Edit by index & NRIC

In FriendlyLink, there are 2 methods to  choose which elderly/volunteer to edit:
- via **index** using the `edit_elderly` and `edit_volunteer` commands.
- via **NRIC** using the `edit` command.

Similar to adding elderly/volunteers, editing is done by specifying the desired field(s) to edit using their prefixes, 
and then providing the new value for the field(s). For consistency, the prefixes between the adding and 
editing commands are kept the same.

For the editing of fields that accept multiple arguments (i.e. `AvailableDate`, `Tag` and `MedicalQualificationTag`),
the specified behaviour is to leaves them unchanged if no new values are provided, else overwrite the existing values 
with the newly provided values.

Retrieving of the desired `Elderly`/`Volunteer` to edit is done differently 
depending on whether `edit_elderly`/`edit_volunteer`
or `edit` is called:
- `edit_elderly`/`edit_volunteer`: The `Elderly`/`Volunteer` is retrieved directly from
the `filteredElderly`/`filteredVolunteer` of `Model`.
- `edit`: We first check if an `Elderly` with the specified NRIC exists in `Model`. 
If so, we retrieve it; Otherwise, we perform a similar check for `Volunteer`, and retrieve it if 
such a `Volunteer` exists.

These edits are performed primarily through the `EditDescriptor` class. This class
contains `Optional` types of the **union** of the fields between `Elderly` and `Volunteer`. In order to "transform"
a given volunteer/elderly with the edited fields, 2 important static methods are provided:
- `createEditedElderly(Elderly, EditDescriptor)`: returns a new `Elderly` representing the given `Elderly` modified 
with the values specified in the `EditDescriptor`
- `createEditedVolunteer(Volunteer, EditDescriptor)`: returns a `Volunteer` representing the given `Volunteer` modified 
with the values specified in the `EditDescriptor`

The `Elderly`/`Volunteer` are then edited in the model using the `setElderly`/`setVolunteer` methods
of `Model` respectively.

Design decisions:
- The reason behind the `editDescriptor` class, as opposed to directly using an `Elderly` or `Volunteer` class, is that
  it better encapsulates the logic behind editing. That is, with the same `editDescriptor` object, we can easily "edit" multiple
  `Elderly` and `Volunteer` objects simply through the `createEditedElderly`/`createEditedVolunteer` methods.
- Initially, we had created 2 separate descriptor classes `ElderlyEditDescriptor` and `VolunteerEditDescriptor`. However,
  we felt that this was simply unnecessary, and combined them into a single `editDescriptor` class instead.

As an example, the following sequence diagram shows the sequence for the command `edit S1234567I n/Shaun ag/21`, where
the NRIC `S1234567I` belongs to an existing **volunteer**:
<img src="images/developerGuide/EditSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Find by keyword

The ```find``` command allows users to easily filter and locate the relevant elderly and volunteers, together with their related parings.
The results of the ```find``` command are displayed as the filtered version of the elderly, volunteers and pairs lists, 
together with the number of entities listed being shown in the command result box.

Volunteers and elderly who match all the provided attributes that they have are filtered out and displayed in their respective list.
For each filtered person, Any pairings that they are involved in will be filtered and displayed in the pair list.

Arguments for the ```find``` command involve at least one of the attributes belonging to an elderly or a volunteer.
Any number of attributes can be specified but if multiple of the same attribute is specified then only the last one will be
used in the search.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the execution of the ```find``` command.

<img src="images/developerGuide/FindSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

The command execution flow is as given below
1. The ```LogicManager``` will begin the execution of the command.
2. Input parsed by ```FriendlyLinkParser``` which creates and return a ```FindCommandParser```.
3. The ```FindCommandParser``` parses the arguments and returns a ```FindCommand``` with the relevant predicates.
4. The ```LogicManager``` executes the ```FindCommand```.
5. The ```FindCommand``` combines the relevant predicates for elderly and volunteers and calls ```updateFilteredElderlyList``` and ```updateFilteredVoolunteerList``` of ```Model```.
6. Based on the filtered elderly and volunteers a predicate to get the related pairs is created and ```updateFilteredPairList``` of ```Model``` is called.
7. ```CommandResult``` with the sizes of the 3 filtered lists is created and returned.

The class diagram below shows the relation of predicates to ```FindCommandParser``` and ```FindCommand```.

<img src="images/developerGuide/FindCommandClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

Design decisions:
- Name, address, email, phone, tags and medical qualification attributes allow substring searching.
  - Easier to search with only partial information available.
- When multiple attributes and stated, the result must match all instead of any.
  - The search should narrow the field with each additional new attribute for a more targeted result.
- Related pairings are also shown during the search.
  - Provides a comprehensive search results where all information related to the people found are shown.
- People with available dates that contain the specified dates or have no available dates will be found when searching with the specified dates.
  - They are found because they are available on the specified dates.

### Pairing and unpairing of elderly and volunteers

Pairs are implemented as a class with 2 referenced attributes, `Elderly` and `Volunteer`.
* This allows the NRIC of a person in the pair to be automatically updated when the person is updated.

The pairs are stored in a list similar to persons.

* Allows for filtering to display a subset of pairs in the UI.
* Allows for identifying a pair by index.

Two pairs are identical if they have the same elderly and volunteer NRIC.

* Just like persons, we do not allow duplicate pairs (due to add or edit pair)
* Elderly and volunteer NRIC is used to identify a pair for deletion.

### Summary Statistics

The `stats` command displays summary statistics about FriendlyLink, such as the total number of elderly, volunteers and unpaired persons.

It is implemented using the `Summary` and `AggregateFunction` class.

The `AggregateFunction`
* describes a particular statistic of FriendlyLink with a number.
* is an abstract class that requires concrete classes to override the `getDescription()` and `getResult()` method.

The `Summary` object
* formats the results to be displayed to the user.
* takes in 0 or more `AggregateFunction`s to show their description and results.

<img src="images/developerGuide/StatsCommandClassDiagram.png" width="500" />

The `StatsCommand` keeps a `Summary` object. When `StatsCommand`'s `execute` method is called, it creates all the `AggregateFunction`s with appropriate arguments and passes them to the `Summary` to be described.

<img src="images/developerGuide/StatsSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />
 
### Storage
This section specifies how entities such as `Elderly`, `Volunteer` and `Pair` are stored on disk.

Elderly, volunteers and pairs are stored in separate files to reduces the impact of a corrupted file, since it will only affect either elderly or volunteers.

#### Persons

Persons saved contains all their attributes such as name, NRIC, in JSON format.
* Single value attributes are stored as key value pairs, such as name and NRIC.
* Multiple value attributes such as tag and available date sets are stored as JSON lists.

#### Pairs

Pairs saved only contains the NRIC of the elderly and volunteer in JSON format.

**Reasons**
* Reduce space needed to store pairs.
* Reduce chance of inconsistent data between a person and the corresponding pair.
* Reduce number of files to amend manually when updating person information.

**Implications**
* A pair is reconstructed on startup by searching the model for the corresponding person.
* Elderly and volunteer files need to be read into the model before pair files.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements


When creating software, there are always areas that can be improved upon.
In the interest of transparency and keeping our users informed, we have identified some aspects
of our product that we recognise as feature flaws. We appreciate your patience as
we are actively working to find the best solution to address these feature flaws.

### Editing a pair by index: `edit_pair`

Currently, editing a pair by index has not been implemented. This feature can increase the efficiency of using FriendlyLink.
This feature was originally deemed low priority, since a pair only has 2 fields: elderly and volunteer, and thus users can reasonably still achieve this by deleting a pair and adding a new pair. Through user feedback, we acknowledge that this is still a useful feature to have to improve efficiency and user experience.

Proposed usage: Edits an existing pair based on their index in the pairs list.
Proposed format: `edit_pair INDEX [eic/ELDERLY_NRIC] [vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC]`

Proposed behaviour:
* Edits the pair at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed pair list.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:
* `edit_pair 1 eic/T0245267I` Edits the 1st pair so that the volunteer is paired to the elderly with NRIC `T0245267I` instead.

### Deleting a pair by index: `delete_pair`

Currently, pairs are deleted by specifying NRIC of both elderly and volunteer. This feature can increase the efficiency of using FriendlyLink, if we allow users to simply specify the index of the pair.
This feature is originally implemented as such to prevent accidental deletion of pairs, as it is easy to enter the wrong index but hard to accidentally enter a pair of incorrect NRICs and delete the wrong pair. Through user feedback, we acknowledge that we should implement it to delete by index and support this with an `undo` feature to minimise impact of accidental deletions.

Proposed usage: Deletes an existing pair based on their index in the pairs list.
Proposed format: `edit_pair INDEX [eic/ELDERLY_NRIC] [vic/VOLUNTEER_NRIC]`

Proposed behaviour:
* Edits the pair at the specified `INDEX` in the displayed pair list.
* Any combination of the optional fields is possible but **at least one** optional field must be specified.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

### Display birthdate in person cards

When users provide a birthdate for an Elderly or Volunteer profile, only the person's current age is displayed in the app. To view the specific birthdate, users must refer to the respective JSON file.
We should include birthdate in each person's information card as well.

### Enhance display of large number of tags

There are no limits on the number of tags or the character limit for each tag. If large number of tags or tags with excessively long names are used, it affects the UI display and impact user experience.
We plan to limit each tag within 50 characters, with the total number of tags being less than 20.
This would ensure decent degree of input flexibility, while not severely clogging up the UI display.

### Enhance display of pair information

Currently, users need to mouse over the pair card to view information of each pair. This reduces the efficiency of FriendlyLink, which is intended to be optimised for typing.
We plan to add a command to view pairing details directly as information cards. This would help to improve efficiency of display.

### Enhance effectiveness of autoPair feature

autoPair algorithm for pairing up volunteers and elderly users employs a greedy approach, which may not always be the most optimal in terms of time efficiency or number of pairings we can automatically pair.
We are continuously searching for better pairing algorithms.

### Enhance available dates feature

Currently, available dates take in dates and not time of day.
We should improve it to also allow users to enter time into the availability fields, such as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` to provide greater flexibility in specifying availability period.

### Enhance name to accept special characters

Currently, names do not accept `.` and `\\`. This may cause some problems where a person's legal name contains these special characters.
We should modify the name to accept these special characters.

### Enhance warning message for input validation

Currently, when a wrong command or prefix is entered, the input will simply turn red. While this may be intuitive for experienced users,
it may not provide the best experience for new users. As such, we intend to implement a feature which can convert the current recommendation
feature to also display the warning. For example, if the user enters `add_person`, this is currently an invalid command,
so the corresponding error message will be displayed in the same text box (replacing the command recommendation).

## Appendix: Efforts

**Adding records**

1. This task is of medium difficulty. We managed to implement a variety of attribute fields, such as available dates as date ranges, medical qualifications as tags, and regions as enums. 
2. Given the different attribute data types, transferring these fields into formats adaptable for JSON storage become the main challenge.
3. Furthermore, as we made many of the fields optional, making the tracking and recording of fields with `NULL` values compatible with JSON, given the various data types, becomes another challenge.
4. Despite these challenges, we successfully added comprehensive and flexible record-keeping capabilities to the system.

**Deleting records**

1. This task is of medium difficulty. We managed to implement logic checks ensuring the logical correctness of deletion. For example, when deleting an elderly record, we also had to delete all of its existing pairs. To ensure the accuracy and correctness, we wrote many unit test cases. 
2. Through careful testing and debugging, we successfully implemented a reliable and robust deletion feature.

**Pairing feature** 

1. This task is of medium difficulty. The main effort involved taking references of elderly and volunteer information instead of copying it, so that when a person's information is edited, deleted, or searched, the corresponding pairing situation can be displayed.

**Editing records**

1. This task is of medium difficulty. We had to correctly handle all possible correct and incorrect inputs, particularly when we had an 'edit' command that was usable by both elderly and volunteer users.
2. Through careful unit testing and debugging, we successfully implemented a feature that automatically ignored non-applicable edit fields and update all applicable information.

**Finding records**

1. Finding information was of high difficulty. We had to correctly handle different possible situations, such as when a user entered a wrong field format or a field that was not applicable to the person or when different searching formats were used for enums, date tags, etc. 
2. Additionally, we had to simultaneously filter elderly, volunteer, and pair cards and display all possible information.
3. Through extensive testing and refinement, we successfully implemented a powerful and flexible searching feature.

**Command Recommendation**

1. Implementing the command recommendation feature was of high difficulty. The main challenges were showing the correct command recommendations as the user typed each character and throwing warnings at the correct times.
2. For example, the main challenges include that we had to distinguish between "wrong command" and "incomplete command", as well as detecting existing attributes to avoid repetitive recommendations.
3. For this feature, we make use of the [Agolia Documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/solutions/ecommerce/search/autocomplete/predictive-search-suggestions/) 
4. We successfully achieved this feature, which effectively increased input speed and user satisfaction.
