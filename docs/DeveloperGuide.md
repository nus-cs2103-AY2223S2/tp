</div>

### Architecture

Below is a quick overview of the main components of the app and how they interact with each other.

To better illustrate and explain the high-level design of the App, we have also included the _**Architecture Diagram**_ below.

<img class="diagram" src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="400px">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Main components of the architecture

The `Main` part of the app has 2 classes called `Main` and `MainApp`. Its responsibilities are:

* On startup: Initializes all components in the appropriate sequence (storage, model, logic, UI) 
  and connects them with each other.

* On shutdown: Shuts down all the components and invokes cleanup methods wherever necessary.

The `Commons` package represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components, storing information such as GUI settings and user-visible error messages.

The rest of the App is comprised of four components, each in their own package of related files, with the following main responsibilities:

* `UI`: The user interface of the app.
* `Logic`: The command executor.
* `Model`: Holds the data of the App in memory.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows how the different components interact with each other for the 
scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img class="diagram" src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="539px">

Each of the four main components as shown in the diagram above,
* defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component name}Manager` class
  (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned above).

For instance, the `Logic` component defines its APi in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface.
Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (in order to prevent external components being coupled to the implementation of a component) as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img class="diagram" src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300px">

The following sections will give more details on each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/Ui.java)

<img class="diagram" src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="650px">

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* and depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Recipe` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img class="diagram" src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="500"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the RecipeBookParser class to parse the user command.

2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.

3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a recipe).

4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`("add n/Aglio Olio i/pasta i/pepper")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add n/Aglio Olio i/pasta i/pepper` Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should 
end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img class="diagram" src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="550"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `RecipeBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `RecipeBookParser` returns back as a
  `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/Model.java)

<img class="diagram" src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="500" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the recipe book data i.e., all `Recipe` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueRecipeBook` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Recipe` objects (e.g., results of a search query such as `find` or `list`) as a
  separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` instance that
  can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the
  list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

It is worth noting that to populate their `Recipe` objects with `Ingredient` instances, clients need only 
pass valid `IngredientBuilder` instances to `Recipe` objects.
The `Recipe` class will then populate its own `Ingredient` and `IngredientQuantifier` fields, via the given `IngredientBuilder`
and its use of `IngredientParser`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list and
an `Ingredient` list in the `RecipeBook`, which `Recipe` references. This allows `RecipeBook` to only require
one `Tag` object per unique **tag**, and one `Ingredient` object per unique **ingredient**, instead of each `Recipe`
needing their own `Tag` or `Ingredient` objects.<br/><br/>
This, however is highly complex and adds additional dependencies,
which may in turn introduce more vulnerabilities or points of failure. As such, its implementation is a proposed
extension feature to this project.<br/><br/>

<img class="diagram" src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="500" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/Storage.java)

**Structure:**
<img class="diagram" src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="794" />

<img class="diagram" src="images/JsonAdaptersDiagram.png" width="1089" />

**The `Storage` component:**

* saves both recipe data and user preferences data in JSON format.
* reads saved JSON recipe data and user preferences data into their respective objects.
* inherits from both the `RecipeBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage` interfaces, which means it can be treated as either
  one (if the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the Model component (because the Storage component’s job is to save/retrieve objects that
  belong to the Model).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Implementation:**

Serialization and deserialization of recipe book objects is done using [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).
To serialize a recipe, we must necessarily serialize its component fields too: its `Name`, `RecipePortion`,
`RecipeDuration`, `Tag` set, `Ingredient` list, and `Step` list.

The default JSON representation for each component is to express the fields of each component as key-value pairs.
However, this representation is too verbose and space-inefficient. Hence, we opted to write custom JSON adapters for
each component clas, which can be found in the [`seedu.recipe.storage.jsonadapters`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/jsonadapters) 
package. These JSON adapters allow us to express how each class should be serialized.

### The `Common` component

This component contains classes which are used by multiple components, and are located in the `seedu.recipe.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Feature Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Feature: "Add" Form UI

#### Overview

The `AddRecipeForm` allows users to add new recipes directly through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) form instead of typing in the command box. The following sequence diagram illustrates how the different components interact with one another in the execution of an `addf` command. 

<img class="diagram" src="images/AddFormSequenceDiagram.png" width="1128"/>  

#### Implementation

The `AddRecipeForm` class inherits from the `RecipeForm` base class which extends the `UiPart<Region>` class and initializes various UI components, such as `TextFields`, `TextAreas` that are used for displaying and editing recipe details, and `Buttons` for saving and closing the form.  

The `RecipeForm` class has a constructor that takes a null `Recipe` object, a `StringBuilder` object reference created in `AddFormCommand`, and the `title` of the form.
The fields of the form are pre-populated with the existing recipe's data if a non-null recipe is provided.

After the user modifies and saves the form, the
`AddRecipeForm` modifies this `StringBuilder` reference to capture the form's edited
details in a format which is parseable as an `Recipe` instance, by the app.

In addition, it implements the following operations:

* `RecipeForm#display` —  Displays the form with corresponding UI components such as the <kbd>Save</kbd> button and `TextField` and `TextArea` rows.
* `RecipeForm#getFormData` —  Stores all the changed values in the form fields into a `HashMap`.
* `RecipeForm#collectFields` —  Stores changed recipe fields in the `HashMap` into the "data" `StringBuilder` reference.
* `RecipeForm#saveRecipe()` —  Formats the current recipe by editing the
`StringBuilder` instance such that it contains the command string in a format
that an `AddCommandParser` can parse and understand.
* `RecipeForm#closeForm()` —  Closes the form without saving any changes.

After the user saves the form by clicking on the <kbd>Save</kbd> button, the
command string is passed to the `AddCommandParser` class for parsing into a
`RecipeDescriptor` instance, which will be saved by the app if there are no errors.

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. The user types `addf` in the command box and presses <kbd>Enter</kbd>, triggering the `AddRecipeForm` to appear with empty form fields.

2. The user modifies the recipe's details in the form fields, such as changing the name, duration, portions, ingredients, steps, or tags.

3. The user clicks on the <kbd>Save</kbd> button, causing the `RecipeForm#saveRecipe()` method to be called. Changed values are stored in a new `HashMap` called `changedValues` .

4. `changedValues` is passed to `AddRecipeForm#handle`, which calls `RecipeForm#collectFields` to update the `StringBuilder` instance value. 

5. The form is closed and the updated `StringBuilder` instance containing the command string is passed back to `AddFormCommand`.

6. If the StringBuilder instance is empty, then a `CommandException()` is thrown to indicate that the form was empty.
 Otherwise, `AddFormCommand` calls `AddCommandParser#parseToRecipeDescriptor(commandString)` to convert the command string into a `RecipeDescriptor` instance. 

7. The `RecipeDescriptor` instance is converted to a new `Recipe` instance through `RecipeDescriptor#toRecipe()` and is added to the model through `Model#addRecipe(recipeToAdd)`.
This also relies on the existing infrastructure to validate `Recipe` inputs, and
any formatting errors will raise exceptions which will be returned to the UI of the
App, to indicate the errors to the User.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Feature: "Edit" Form UI

The `EditRecipeForm` allows users to make changes to a recipe details directly over a Graphical User Interface edit form instead of the command box.
The following sequence diagram illustrates how the different components interact with one another in the execution of an edit form command.

<img class="diagram" src="images/EditRecipeFormSequenceDiagram.png" width="1128"/>  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation

Likewise, the `EditRecipeForm` also inherits from the `RecipeForm` base class and hence supports a similar set of operations
as the `AddRecipeForm`. The key difference between the add and edit recipe forms is that the fields of the edit form are
pre-populated with the existing recipe's data if a non-null recipe is provided.

Pre-filling of recipe data into the text fields is implemented through the following additional operations:

* `RecipeForm#saveInitialValues()` —  Stores the initial values of the form fields in a HashMap.
* `RecipeForm#populateFields()` —  Prepopulates the form fields with values of current recipe.

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. The user selects a recipe and presses the <kbd>F</kbd> key, triggering the `RecipeForm` to appear with the selected recipe's details pre-populated in the form fields.
   The initial values of that recipe is stored in a `HashMap` named `initialValues`.

2. The user modifies the recipe's details in the form fields, such as changing the name, duration, portions, ingredients, steps, or tags.

3. The user clicks on the <kbd>Save</kbd> button, causing the `RecipeForm#saveRecipe()` method to be called. 
   This method checks which fields have been changed by comparing their current values with the data stored in `initialValues`. 
 
   Changed values are stored in a new `HashMap` called `changedValues`, which is then collected into 
   the `StringBuilder` instance through `RecipeForm#collectFields`.

4. The form is closed and the new `StringBuilder` instance is returned to `RecipeCard` for execution.

5. The final command text is generated from the `StringBuilder` instance, and along with the `displayedIndex` of the recipe, is passed to an `EditRecipeEvent` object, which is then fired to update the model and subsequently the UI with the edited recipe details.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes the process when a user edits a recipe using the recipe form:

<img class="diagram" src="images/EditRecipeFormActivityDiagram.png" width="1128"/>  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the user clicks the <kbd>Cancel</kbd> button or presses the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key,
the form will be closed without saving any changes.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Feature: Find-by-property

#### Overview

The `find` command allows the user to filter recipes by their properties:
e.g. their name, tags, or ingredients.
The following sequence diagram illustrates how the different components interact with each other
in the execution of a `find tag italian indian` command.

<img class="diagram" src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png" width="1128" />

#### Implementation
As with all commands, the find command goes through the standard command execution pipeline.

In `FindCommandParser`, we determine which is the target property. 
Keyword validation and predicate creation is then done depending on the target property.

To determine whether a recipe's target property matches the given keywords, 2 predicate types are used:

* `PropertyNameContainsKeywordPredicate<T>`: checks whether some string representation of a property T
matches any of the keywords.
  * e.g. if the property is `Name`, and we have a recipe named "Cacio e Pepe" and we are
  finding recipes whose name match the keywords ["Pepe", "Cereal"], then this recipe would match.
* `PropertyCollectionContainsKeywordPredicate<T>`: checks whether a string representation of any property T
in a collection of property T matches any of the keywords.
  * e.g. if the property is `Tag`, and we have a recipe with tags ["Italian", "Breakfast"] and we are
  finding recipes whose tags match the keywords ["Italian", "Indian"], then this recipe would match.

The use of generic types in the above predicates allows it to be implemented independent of the actual type
of the property, as long as the relevant getters are supplied.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Feature: Ingredient Substitutions

#### Overview

The `sub` command allows the user to search for commonly used substitutions for ingredients.

#### Implementation

The sub command likewise goes through the standard command execution pipeline.

In `SubCommandParser`, we determine whether the ingredient defined by the user (to be searched up for substitutes)
is valid using the regex for ingredient names that was previously defined.

In the execution of the sub command, the (valid) ingredient is queried first in a preloaded list of substitutions.
This preloaded list is stored within SubstitutionsUtil and accessed through a getter from the recipe book.
Subsequently, the same ingredient is then queried in every recipe within the recipe book.

Should the ingredient be found in the preloaded list, the corresponding substitutions will be added to the list of
substitutes to be returned to user. Otherwise, should the ingredient be found in any recipe in the recipe book, should
any substitutes for that ingredient be stored, it will likewise be added to the list.

This list is created in the form of a `HashSet` such that any duplicates will not be displayed more than once.

The display of the results will be in the command result box which is different from the other commands, since the
results of the `sub` command return ingredients instead of recipes.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Feature: Import RecipeBook

#### Overview

The `import` command allows the user to import another RecipeBook JSON file into the app, and in so doing, import new **Recipes** to use.

If the imported file parses correctly into a RecipeBook, the recipes in the JSON file will be successfully imported while ignoring duplicates (with respect to the
App's current Recipe Book).
Else, if the file is improperly formatted, the import operation will fail and be
cancelled.

<img class="diagram" src="images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png" width="1128" />

#### Implementation

The `import` command goes through the standard command execution pipeline, skipping the parser phase.

During the execution of the import command, we will call `execute()` on an instance
of the `ImportManager` class. This class, which is a part of the `Storage` package,
allows the user to select another Recipe Book JSON file for import from their file
system. The parsing is performed using the existing `parse` methods in the
`seedu.recipe.commons.util.JsonUtil` class. Afterwards, we will cross-check with
our current RecipeBook to filter out duplicate recipes, and add the remaining
non-duplicate recipes.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the user clicks the <kbd>Cancel</kbd> button or closes the file explorer without
selecting a JSON file, the recipe list will remain unchanged, and nothing will be
imported.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Feature: Export RecipeBook

#### Overview

The `export` command allows the user to export the current Recipe Book as a JSON
file, to a file system location of their choosing. This JSON file will be in a
format which is compatible with the [Import](#feature-import-recipebook) feature.

<img class="diagram" src="images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png" width="1128" />

#### Implementation

The `export` command goes through the standard command execution pipeline, skipping the parser phase.

During the execution of the export command, we will call `execute()` on an instance
of the `ExportManager` class which forms a part of the `Storage` package. This
class allows the user to select a save location for the exported JSON file.

The export function is performed by performing a duplicate save of the current Recipe Book of the app, in addition to its default save location.
If the current RecipeBook has not yet been saved, this command will first trigger
a save into the App's default save location, then create another copy of that JSON
file for export.
The JSON formatting and export operations are performed by the parse methods in
`seedu.recipe.commons.util.JsonUtil` class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the user clicks the <kbd>Cancel</kbd> button or 
closes the file explorer without selecting a save location, the Recipe Book will 
not be exported.

</div>

2. The app should be able to hold up to 1000 recipes without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
  able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The app should have a high level of test coverage to ensure quality.
5. The app should have automated testing and deployment processes to facilitate maintenance.
6. The app should have clean and well-documented code that is easy to maintain and update.
