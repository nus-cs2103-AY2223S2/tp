## **Introducing InternBuddy**

InternBuddy is a desktop application for [Computing undergraduates](#glossary) to manage their internship applications.
It is optimized for typing where it allows you to complete internship management tasks much more efficiently
via the keyboard as compared to using traditional [Graphical User Interface](#glossary) (GUI) applications.
If you are a fast typist who is seeking a one-stop platform to systematically organise your internship applications,
then InternBuddy is the perfect buddy to accompany you during your internship hunt.


InternBuddy runs using Java 11, and is available on the Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

## **About the Developer Guide**

### Objectives of the Developer Guide
This developer guide aims to provide developers with insights into the implementation of InternBuddy and to explain the
design considerations behind its features. It utilises Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams created using
[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) for a visual explanation of the implementation.

Apart from shedding light on InternBuddy's internal details, this developer guide also provides
information on how to conduct feature testing and showcases the user study component that we went through
in the initial development phase for requirements gathering.

Hopefully, this developer guide will enable you to easily set up the InternBuddy project and extend its
functionality if you are interested in doing so.

### Architecture
The ***Architecture Diagram*** shown in Figure 2 explains the high-level design of the App.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="260" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: InternBuddy's architecture diagram</p>


Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI (User Interface) of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

Figure 3 is a *Sequence Diagram* that shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `delete-index 1`.


<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 3: Sequence diagram that shows interactions between components </p>
<br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the Figure 3),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its
functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components
interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class
(reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component),
as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram shown in Figure 4.


<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 4: Partial class diagram for the logic, model and storage components </p>
<br/>


The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/ui/Ui.java).
The class diagram for the UI component is shown in Figure 5.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 5: Class diagram for the UI component </p>
<br/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`InternshipListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that
represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching
`.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Internship` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/logic/Logic.java)

Figure 6 illustrates a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 6: Partial class diagram for the logic component </p>
<br/>



How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InternBuddyParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses such as `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an internship).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.


Figure 7 below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-index 1 2")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-index 1 2` Command](images/DeleteIndexSequenceDiagram.png)


<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 7: Sequence diagram for the delete-index command </p>
<br/>





<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Info:** The lifeline for
`DeleteIndexCommandParser` and `DeleteIndexCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>



Figure 8 shows the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from Figure 6) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="500"/>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 8: Class diagram for parser classes in the logic component </p>
<br/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternBuddyParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser`
(`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes
shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the
`InternBuddyParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `FindCommandParser`, ...) inherit from
the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/model/Model.java)

Figure 9 is a class diagram for the `Model` component.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9: Class diagram for the model component</p>
<br/>

The `Model` component,

* stores the internsip data i.e., all `Internship` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueInternshipList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Internship` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Internship>` that can be 'observed'
(e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Info:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP)
model is shown in Figure 10. It has a `Tag` list in the `InternBuddy`, which `Internship` references. This allows `InternBuddy`
to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Internship` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

</div>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 10: Alternative model that is more OOP</p>
<br/>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/storage/Storage.java)


Figure 11 is a class diagram for the `Storage` component.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="400" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 11: Class diagram for the storage component</p>
<br/>


The `Storage` component,
* can save both internship data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternBuddyStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [`seedu.internship.commons`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/commons) package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Info:** Due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline
for objects in sequence diagrams would always reach the end of the diagrams. However, it is worthy to note that objects
with destroy markers (X) would have been destroyed at the markers.

### Add an Internship - `add`

#### Implementation

Figure 12 shows how the `add` command works.

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 12: Sequence diagram for the add command</p>
<br/>



The following gives a more detailed explanation of the `add` command.


1. When the user enters an `add` command, the `AddCommandParser` parses the user's input.
2. It checks for the following:
   - `n/` followed by the company's name [Compulsory]
   - `r/` followed by the role applied [Compulsory]
   - `s/` followed by the status of the internship application [Compulsory]
   - `d/` followed by the date associated with the entry [Compulsory]
   - `c/` followed by the comment for the entry [Optional]
   - `t/` followed by tags for the entry [Optional]
3. If any of the compulsory fields is missing or any of the fields entered by the user
   does not meet the field requirements, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
4. An `Internship` will be created from the parsed user's input if Step 3 passes.
5. A check is done to see if the `Model` component, which stores all the `Internship` entries,
   contains the `Internship` created in Step 4.
6. If a duplicate `Internship` is found, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
7. Else if there is no duplicate `Internship`, the `Internship` created will be added into
   the `Model` component.
8. The currently selected `Internship` in the `Model` component will be updated to become
   this new `Internship` such that the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) displays the information for
   this new `Internship`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

- Whether to make all fields in the `add` command compulsory

1. **Alternative 1 (chosen): Make only essential fields compulsory**
    * Pros: More user-centric as not all users want to enter the optional information,
            which is not exactly critical in tracking internships.
    * Cons: More work needs to be done in code implementation. For example, the absence of optional
            fields should not cause a `ParseException`, and there is a need to include a
            default value of `NA` for input without any `Comment`.

2. **Alternative 2: Make all fields compulsory**
    * Pros: Easier to implement as there is no need to differentiate between compulsory
            and optional fields during command parsing, and it is easier to compare between
            different `Internship` since we just require an exact match of all fields.
    * Cons: Less user-centric where users who do not want to include `Comment` and `Tag`
            are forced to input something for the `Add` command to work.

<br/>

- Whether to update the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) according to the `add` command

1. **Alternative 1 (chosen): Update the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) whenever a new** `Internship` **is added**
    * Pros: Better visual indication that the `add` command has been successfully executed.
      If the user has  a lot of `Internship` entries, when a new `Internship` is added,
      the new entry will be placed at the bottom of the [List Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started),
      which is not visible  if the user's scroll position is at the top of the
      [List Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started). Therefore, updating
      the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) enhances visual indication to the user
      that the `Internship` has been successfully added.
    * Cons: An additional line of code is required in the `execute` method of `AddCommand`
      to update the selected `Internship` in the `Model` component in order to update
      the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started).

2. **Alternative 2: Do not update the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) when a new** `Internship` **is added**
    * Pros: No additional code is required in the `execute` method of `AddCommand`.
    * Cons: When the user has a lot of `Internship` entries, the added entry in the
      [List Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) may not be visible since it is added to the bottom.
      Without scrolling, users have to rely on the [Result Display](#setting-up-and-getting-started) to
      determine if the `AddCommand` is successful.

### Edit an Internship - `edit`

#### Implementation


Figure 13 shows how the `edit` command works.

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 13: Sequence diagram for the edit command</p>
<br/>


The following gives a more detailed explanation of the `edit` command.

1. When the user enters an `edit` command, the `EditCommandParser` parses the user's input.
2. If the internship index specified is invalid, a `ParseException` will be thrown and the specified `Internship` will not be edited.
3. If the company name, role, status, date, tag or comment fields are missing (at least one must be present) or invalid, a `ParseException` will be thrown and the specified `Internship` will not be edited.
4. After the successful parsing of user input into `EditCommandParser`, the `EditCommand` object is created with a new updated `Internship` object (to maintain immutability).
5. Following which, `EditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which eventually calls the `Model#setInternship(Internship toEdit, Internship edited)` method, replacing the old `Internship` object with the newly updated one.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

- How `edit` executes

1. **Alternative 1 (chosen): Edit command will create a new** `Internship` **to replace the existing** `Internship` **object.**
    * Pros:
        * Maintains immutability of `Internship` class.
    * Cons:
        * May be less efficient than Alternative 2.

2. **Alternative 2: Edit command will directly edit the** `Internship` **by modifying its attributes**.
    * Pros:
        * Will use less memory (no new `Internship` object will be created).
        * Saves time since there is no need to create the new object.
    * Cons:
        * Reduces the defensiveness of the code and the class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View an Internship - `view`

#### Implementation
Figure 14 shows how the `view` command works.

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 14: Sequence diagram for the view command</p>
<br/>

The following gives a more detailed explanation of the `view` command.


1. When the user enters a `view` command, the `ViewCommandParser` parses the user's input.
2. It checks for the following:
   - The `INDEX` entered by the user must be able to be converted into a numeric index.
3. If the user entered a value of `INDEX` that cannot be converted, a `ParseException` will
   be thrown.
4. An `Index` will be created from the user's input if Step 2 passes.
5. A check is done to see if the `Index` created in Step 4 is a valid index given the number
   of `Internship` entries in the filtered `Internship` list of the `Model` component.
6. If the `Index` is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
7. Else if the `Index` is valid, the `Internship` which belongs to that `Index` will be
   retrieved by accessing the filtered `Internship` list.
8. The currently selected `Internship` in the `Model` component will be updated to become
   the `Internship` obtained from Step 7 such that the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) displays the
   information for this selected `Internship`.


#### Design Considerations

- Whether to separate the checking of valid user input into 2 classes

1. **Alternative 1: Allow** `ViewCommand` **to handle the checking of whether user input can be
   parsed into an index, and whether it is a valid index**
    * Pros: No need for a separate `ViewCommandParser` class and any problems with checking of
      user input can be isolated to the `ViewCommand` class.
    * Cons: Breaks the abstraction where parsing of user input should be done by a `Parser`
      class instead of a `Command` class.

2. **Alternative 2 (chosen): Allow** `ViewCommandParser` **to handle checking of whether user input
   can be parsed into an index, and `ViewCommand` to handle checking of whether it
   is a valid index**
    * Pros: Maintains the abstraction between the `Parser` and `Command` classes. Also, it
      makes it more maintainable for future extensions in the event that further checks
      to the user input are required.
    * Cons: Have to maintain code in 2 separate classes and in the event that there
      is an issue in processing user input for the `ViewCommand`, there is a need to
      identify and isolate which of the 2 checks does the problem originate from.

### Copy an Internship to Clipboard - `copy`
#### Implementation
Figure 15 shows how the `copy` command works.

![CopySequenceDiagram](images/CopySequenceDiagram.png)

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 15: Sequence diagram for the copy command</p>
<br/>


The following gives a more detailed explanation of the `copy` command.

1. When the user enters a `copy` command, the `CopyCommandParser` parses the user's input.
2. It checks for the following:
   - The `INDEX` entered by the user must be able to be converted into a numeric index.
3. If the user entered a value of `INDEX` that cannot be converted, a `ParseException` will
   be thrown.
4. An `Index` will be created from the user's input if Step 2 passes.
5. A check is done to see if the `Index` created in Step 4 is a valid index given the number
   of `Internship` entries in the filtered `Internship` list of the `Model` component.
6. If the `Index` is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
7. Else if the `Index` is valid, the `Internship` which belongs to that `Index` will be
   retrieved by accessing the filtered `Internship` list.
8. Following which, `CopyCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which eventually calls the `Model#copyInternship(Internship target)` method. This copies the `toString()` representation of the `Internship` object onto the clipboard.

#### Design Considerations

- How to run the clipboard operation

1. **Alternative 1: Run the clipboard code directly.**
   * Will work if the testing framework is already running on the event dispatch thread (such as JUnit Swing or FEST-Swing). However, this is
     not the case for this project.

2. **Alternative 2: (chosen): Use the** `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()` **method to wrap the clipboard code in a Runnable object**
   * Ensures that the clipboard operation is safe to run from a test or a non-GUI context.

### Find Internships - `find`
#### Implementation

Figure 16 shows how the `find` command works.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 16: Sequence diagram for the find command</p>
<br/>




The following gives a more detailed explanation of the `find` command.

1. If the name, role, status, date and tag fields are all missing or one of their values are invalid, a `ParseException` will be thrown and the `FindCommand` will not be executed.
2. After the successful parsing of user input into `FindCommandParser`, an `InternshipContainsKeywordPredicate` object, containing the lists of keywords specified in the user input, is created, which in turn is used to create a `FindCommand` object.
3. Following which, the `FindCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which eventually calls the `updateFilteredInternshipList(Predicate<Internship> predicate)` method with the `InternshipContainsKeywordPredicate` object, previously created by `FindCommandParser`, as its argument and updates the `FilteredList<Internship>` stored inside the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

- How `find` command uses user input

1. **Alternative 1 (chosen): Find an internship by exact match of user input and the** `Internship` **object's corresponding attributes.**
    * Pros:
        * Instructions on how to use the find command will be clear and easily communicated to user.
    * Cons:
        * Restrictive for the user (e.g. An internship with the company name `Google Ltd` will not turn up for the command `find n/Google`).

2. **Alternative 2: Find an internship by match of user input and the substrings in the** `Internship` **object's attributes**.
    * Pros:
        * Command is much more flexible (e.g. An internship with the company name `Google` will turn up for the find command `find n/goo`).
    * Cons:
        * May be confusing for the user (e.g. The user assumes that the `find` command works for matching substrings of individual words. He inputs `find n/goo inc` for an `Internship` with company name `Google Incorporated`).

3. **Alternative 3: Find an internship by match of any word of user input and any word of the** `Internship` **object's corresponding attributes.**
    * Pros:
        * Command is much more flexible.
    * Cons:
        * Command becomes too flexible (e.g. A `find` command like `find n/google ltd` will return `Internship` objects that have either the word `google` or `ltd` in their company names. Internships with company names such as `Apple ltd` and `Meta Ltd` will be returned.

### Get Upcoming Events and Deadlines - `upcoming`

#### Implementation
Figure 17 shows how the `upcoming` command works.

![UpcomingSequenceDiagram](images/UpcomingSequenceDiagram.png)
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 17: Sequence diagram for the upcoming command</p>
<br/>

The following gives a more detailed explanation of the `upcoming` command.
1. When the user enters an `upcoming` command, an `UpcomingCommand` object is created.
2. Following which, `FilteredList<Internship>` stored inside the model will be updated by checking each internship entry against a predicate.
3. The predicate checks whether both of the following conditions are met: 
- The `STATUS` of the internship must be one of the following:
  - `NEW`
  - `ASSESSMENT`
  - `INTERVIEW`
  - `OFFERED`
- The `DATE` must be within the upcoming week.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

- Whether to include all possible statuses of an internship

1. **Alternative 1 (chosen): The predicate for the** `upcoming` **command should be limited to internships that have the status** `NEW/ASSESSMENT/INTERVIEW/OFFERED`.
    * Pros: Makes more practical sense as these statuses have dates that are tied to an event or deadline:
      * `NEW` - Deadline of Application
      * `ASSESSMENT` - Date of Assessment
      * `INTERVIEW` - Date of Interview
      * `Offered` - Deadline of Offer Acceptance
    * Cons: If the instructions for using the command are not clearly explained in the user guide, users may have difficulty understanding the output that is generated.
   
2. **Alternative 2: Internships with any status would be accepted, even with statuses that are not tied to an upcoming event or deadline.**
    * Pros: May be more intuitive for users to understand.
    * Cons: This may cause users to forget the intended use case of the command, leading to confusion or misuse.

### Delete Internship Entries by Fields - `delete-field`
#### Implementation
Figure 18 shows how the `delete-field` command works.

![DeleteFieldSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteFieldSequenceDiagram.png)
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 18: Sequence diagram for the delete-field command</p>
<br/>

The following gives a more detailed explanation of the `delete-field` command.

1. When the user enters a `delete-field` command, the  `DeleteFieldCommandParser` parses the user's input. It attempts to parse the arguments as a set of prefixed
fields (`[n/COMPANY_NAME] [r/ROLE] [s/STATUS] [d/DATE] [t/TAG]`).
2. A new `InternshipContainsKeywordPredicate` object is created. A `DeleteFieldCommand` object is then created.
3. When the `DeleteFieldCommand` object executes, a list of `Internship` objects is obtained with `model.getFilteredInternshipList()`.
4. For each `Internship` object in the list that matches with **at least one** value for
  **every** field type that is specified, it will be deleted using `model.deleteInternship(internshipToDelete)`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

- **Whether to use an AND relationship or an OR relationship between different fields**
   * For example, should `delete-field n\Google r\Software Engineer` delete internships that have company name of Google AND role as Software Engineer, or delete internships that have company name of Google OR role of Software Engineer?

1. **Alternative 1 (chosen):  Use an AND relationship**
    * Pros: More user-centric as users will be able to have more fine-grained control over what internships they want to delete. For example, they may want to delete all internship entries related to a certain company AND role.
    * Cons: If users want to delete internships based on an OR relationships, they need to call `delete-field` multiple times.

2. **Alternative 2: Use an OR relationship**
    * Pros: Much easier for the user to reason about which internships will be deleted.
    * Cons: Less fine-grained control over `delete`. For example, there is no way to delete internships that have company name of Google AND role of Software Engineer

<br/>

- **Whether to add this enhancement to the** `clear` **or** `delete` **command, or to create a new command entirely**

1. **Alternative 1 (chosen):** Split the `delete` command into `delete-index` and `delete-field`. `delete-index` will delete only indices, while `delete-field` will only delete by fields.
    * Pros: Both commands now share the same prefix `delete`, so it is easier to remember.
    * Cons: Delete now has 2 formats, and this may be a source of confusion.
2. **Alternative 2: Enhance the** `delete` **command only. For example,** `delete 1 2 n/Google` **will delete any of the first 2 entries if they have a company name of** `Google`.
    * Pros: Combining all delete features into one command makes it easier to remember.
    * Cons: 
      * Very difficult to justify usage. It is unlikely for a user to require such absolute fine-grained control. A more likely use case is to mass delete internships that are no longer required.
      * Difficult to define a suitable interpretation of the fields. For example, in the command `delete 1 2 n/Google`, 
      the command should delete internships with (Index 1 OR 2) AND have a company name `Google`. Maintaining both AND and OR relationships can be confusing for the user.
      
3. **Alternative 3: Enhance the** `clear` **command**.
    * Pros: The current `clear` command takes in no arguments, so it is much easier to implement.
    * Cons: May be confusing to the user, since there will be no clear distinction between `delete` and `clear`.

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product Scope

**Target user profile:**
[Computing Undergraduates](#glossary)

**Characteristics of user profile:**
* Has a need to manage many internship applications

Internships form an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum for Computing Undergraduates. 
In a technical field like Computing, it is especially important for undergraduates to practice what they have learnt in classrooms.
However, given the tight competition in the market, many undergraduates source for numerous internship opportunities
before being accepted for one. Therefore, many Computing undergraduates face the need to track many applications
where each could be in a different phase of the application process.

* Prefers typing to mouse interactions, with good typing speed

Computing undergraduates have great exposure to computer usage where coding assignments and projects in school require
extensive typing. This justifies a sufficiently good level of proficiency with regard to typing. In fact, with the
existence of keyboard shortcuts, many programmers prefer typing over using the mouse because of the efficiency gains.


* Reasonably comfortable in using [Command Line Interface](#glossary) (CLI) apps

CLI provides a simple way to interact with computers to run programs and manage files.
Computing undergraduates are taught how to use the CLI in their curriculums, and are often required to use it
to run system tasks that cannot be done over the GUI. Hence, this would imply a reasonable level of comfort in using
the CLI interface.


* Prefers desktop applications over other types

**Value proposition**:

InternBuddy aims to provide a 1-stop platform for a computing undergraduate to view and
manage his internship applications. Consolidating internship information, the application provides organisational
capabilities for easy tracking and follow-ups while eliminating the need to handle data across multiple platforms.

### Add an Internship

1. `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/New d/2023-03-01 c/Considering to apply t/Payment`

   **Expected**: A new internship entry is successfully added. The new internship entry will have company name
   `Visa`, role `Software Engineer`, status `New`, deadline of application `2023-03-01`, comment `Considering to apply`,
   and tag `Payment`. The View Panel displays the information for this new internship entry, and a success
   message is displayed in the Result Display.

2. `add n/Mastercard r/Software Engineer s/New d/2023-03-01`

   **Expected**: A new internship entry is successfully added. The new internship entry will have company name
   `Mastercard`, role `Software Engineer`, status `New`, deadline of application `2023-03-01`. The View Panel displays the information for this new internship entry, where the comment is shown as `NA`. A success message
   is displayed in the Result Display.

3. `add n/Visa s/New d/2023-03-01`

   **Expected**: No new internship is added. An error message is displayed in the Result Display.
   This is because the compulsory field for role is missing.
 
4. `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/Applying d/2023-03-01`

   **Expected**: No new internship is added. An error message is displayed in the Result Display.
   This is because `Applying` is not a valid value for the `STATUS` field.

5. `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/Applied d/1st March 2023`

   **Expected**: No new internship is added. An error message is displayed in the Result Display.
   This is because the field for `DATE` must be in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`.

6. `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/Applied d/2023-02-32`

   **Expected**: No new internship is added. An error message is displayed in the Result Display.
   This is because `2023-02-32` is not a valid date (i.e. March does not have 32 days).

7. `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/Applied d/2023-02-15 c/`

   **Expected**: No new internship is added. An error message is displayed in the Result Display.
   This is because the `COMMENT` field cannot be left blank.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

   **Expected**: The company name of the internship entry whose original company name is `Google` is updated
   to become `Google Technologies`. The View Panel displays the updated details for this internship entry.

6. Unsuccessful editing through the filtered internship list
    1. `find n/Apple n/Google`
    2.  `edit 3 n/Google Technologies`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because in the filtered
   internship list, there are only 2 internship entries, implying that`3` is not a valid value for the
   `INDEX` field.

7. `edit 2 n/Amazon Technologies s/Applying`

   **Expected**: No internship is edited. An error message is displayed in the Result Display.
     This is because `Applying` is an invalid status.

8. `edit`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because a minimum of 1
   optional field must be specified.

9. `edit -2 n/Amazon Technologies`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because the `INDEX`
   field must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

10. `edit 12 n/Amazon Technologies`

    **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because there are only
    7 internship entries in the sample data. Index 12 is out of range.

   name is `Google`.

3. Unsuccessful viewing through the filtered internship list
    1. `find n/Apple n/Google`
    2.  `view 3`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because in the filtered
   internship list, there are only 2 internship entries, implying that `3` is not a valid value for the
   `INDEX` field.

4. `view -1`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because the `INDEX`
   field must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

5. `view 1 2`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because the `view`
   command does not support viewing of more than 1 internship entry simultaneously.

6. `view 12`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because there are only
   7 internship entries in the sample data. Index 12 is out of range.

7. `view`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because the compulsory
   `INDEX` field is missing.

   name is `Google`.

3. Unsuccessful copying through the filtered internship list
    1. `find n/Apple n/Google`
    2.  `copy 3`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because in the filtered
   internship list, there are only 2 internship entries, implying that `3` is not a valid value for the
   `INDEX` field.

4. `copy -1`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because the `INDEX`
   field must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

5. `copy 1 2`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because the `copy`
   command does not support copying of more than 1 internship entry simultaneously.

6. `copy 12`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because there are only
   7 internship entries in the sample data. Index 12 is out of range.

7. `copy`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because the compulsory
   `INDEX` field is missing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Internships
Assumptions: The sample data provided by InternBuddy is used, where there is a total of 7 internship entries.
1. `find n/Amazon`

   **Expected**: The List Panel shows the internship entry whose company name matches with
   `Amazon`. A success message is displayed in the Result Display.

2. `find n/Amazon n/Google`

   **Expected**: The List Panel shows the internship entries whose company name  matches with
   `Amazon` or `Google`. A success message is displayed in the Result Display.

3. Finding through the filtered internship list
    1. `find n/Apple n/Google`
    2. `find n/Amazon`

   **Expected**: The List Panel shows the internship entry whose company name matches with
   `Amazon`. This means that for the `find` command, the search is always done in the **unfiltered list**
   even if the List Panel was showing a filtered list.

4. `find`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because a minimum of 1
   optional field must be specified.

5. `find s/Applied s/Interviewing`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because `Interviewing`
   is not a valid value for the `STATUS` field.

6. `find n/Google n/Samsung s/Applied s/Assessment`

   **Expected**: Only the internship entry with company name `Google` and status `Assessment` is
   filtered out. This is because all other internship entries do not have a matching value with both
   `CompanyName` and `Status`.

7. `find s/Assessment s/Interview t/Golang`

   **Expected**: Only the internship entry with status `Assessment` and tag `Golang` is filtered out.
   This is because all other internship entries do not have a matching value with both `Status` and
   `Tag`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Get Upcoming Events and Deadlines

1. `upcoming`

   **Expected**: All internship entries with events or deadlines in the upcoming week are
   listed out and displayed in the List Panel.


2. `upcoming hello`

   **Expected**: All internship entries with events or deadlines in the upcoming week are
   listed out and displayed in the List Panel.


3. `upcoming edit 1 n/Apples`

   **Expected**: All internship entries with events or deadlines in the upcoming week are
   listed out and displayed in the List Panel.


### Delete Internships by Indices
Prerequisites: List all internships using the `list` command. Multiple internships are present in the list.

1. `delete-index 1`

   **Expected**: The first internship entry in the List Panel is deleted. If the View Panel was displaying
   the details of the deleted internship entry, it defaults to displaying the welcome message.

2. `delete-index 1 2`

   **Expected**: The first and second internship entry in the List Panel are deleted. If the View
   Panel was displaying the details of either of the deleted internship entries, it defaults to displaying
   the welcome message.

3. `delete-index 3 1 3 3 1`

   **Expected**: The first and third internship entries in the List Panel are deleted. If the View Panel was
   displaying the details of either of the deleted internship entries, it defaults to displaying the
   welcome message.

4. `delete-index`

    **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because a minimum of 1
    index must be specified.


### Delete Internships by Fields
Assumptions: The sample data provided by InternBuddy is used, where there is a total of 7 internship entries.
1. `delete-field n/Amazon`

   **Expected**: The internship entry whose company name matches with `Amazon` is deleted.
   A success message is displayed in the Result Display.

2. `delete-field n/Amazon n/Google`

   **Expected**: The internship entries whose company name is either `Amazon` or `Google` are deleted.
    A success message is displayed in the Result Display.

3. Deleting through the filtered internship list
    1. `find n/Apple n/Google`
    2. `delete-field n/Amazon`

   **Expected**: No internship is deleted. This is because in the List Panel, there is no internship
   with company name `Amazon`. This shows that `delete-field` searches through the **filtered list**.

4. `delete-field`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because a minimum of 1
   optional field must be specified.

5. `delete-field s/Applied s/Interviewing`

   **Expected**: An error message is displayed in the Result Display. This is because `Interviewing`
   is not a valid value for the `STATUS` field.

6. `delete-field n/Google n/Samsung s/Assessment s/Applied`

   **Expected**: Only the internship with company name `Google` and status `Assessment` is deleted,
   because all the other internships do not have a matching field for both `CompanyName` and `Status`.

7. `delete-field s/Assessment s/Interview t/Android`

   **Expected**: Only the internship with status `Interview` and tag `Android` is deleted, because
   all the other internships do not have a matching field for both `Status` and `Tag`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Clear all Internships

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Appendix C: Planned Enhancements**
While we strive to make InternBuddy a perfect product for you, there are nevertheless areas of improvement.
Hence, we are constantly striving to make InternBuddy better. This appendix documents some of the areas
that our team is currently working on, and we would release them in the future once their functionalities
have been finalised.

### Make Prefixes Case-Insensitive
#### Problem
Prefixes are case-sensitive, hence command arguments such as `T/` will be interpreted as plain text. In InternBuddy, command prefixes are lowercase. For example, `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/New d/2023-03-01 t/javascript T/react` will add an internship entry with company name
`Visa`, role `Software Engineer`, status `New`, deadline of application `2023-03-01`, 
and tag `javascript T/react` (refer to Figure 19).
Therefore, it is possible to add substrings such as `T/`, `C/` or `R/` to any of the fields, even though the user could have intended to enter `t/`, `c/` or `r/`. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dg-case-sensitive-prefix-add-example.png" width="500" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 19: Adding the tag 'javascript T/react'</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

We originally intended for this design to allow maximum flexibility for the user. If the user had entered something wrongly, it is possible to just use the command `edit`. However, this design could have an unintentional side-effect.

To illustrate this side effect, we use an example of the `find` command. `find t/javascript t/react` tries to find entries with either the tag `javascript` or `react` (refer to Figure 20). Tag matching is case-insensitive, so it also tries to find `Javascript` or `React` (refer to Figure 21). Similarly, `delete-field t/javascript t/react` tries to delete entries with either the tag `javascript` or `react` or `Javascript` or `React`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dg-case-sensitive-find-before.png" width="500" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 20: Find the tags "javascript" and "react" </p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dg-case-sensitive-find-after.png" width="500" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 21: Result of the find command in figure 20 </p>

There could be another conflicting meaning of the command. In this case, instead of trying to find entries with either the tag `javascript` or `react`, the user could have intended to find the tag `javascript T/react`. This could lead to some confusion.

#### Proposed Design Tweak
Make prefixes for all commands with prefixes (`add`, `edit`, `find`, `delete-field`) case-insensitive. For example, `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/New d/2023-03-01 t/javascript t/react` should have the same result as `add n/Visa r/Software Engineer s/New d/2023-03-01 t/javascript T/react`, where `t/` and `T/` both refer to the tag field. The new internship entry will have company name `Visa`, role `Software Engineer`, status `New`, deadline of application `2023-03-01`, and the tags `javascript` and `react`. The View Panel displays the information for this new internship entry, and a success
message is displayed in the Result Display. Do refer to Figures 22 and 23 for an illustrated example.


<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dg-case-insensitive-add-before.png" width="500" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 22: Adding a new entry with case-insensitive prefix</p>


<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dg-case-insensitive-add-after.png" width="500" />
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 23: Result of the add command in figure 22</p>


A possible implementation is to change the `findPrefixPosition()` method in `seedu.internship.logic.parser.ArgumentTokenizer` as shown in Figure 24. Instead of finding the first exact match of the prefix, the method tries to find the first case-insensitive match of the prefix.


<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dg-case-insensitive-prefix-fix.png" />
</p>



<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 24: The parser checks for both lowercase prefix and uppercase prefix</p>

This would address the above problem. For example, `find t/javascript t/react` should have the same result as `find T/javascript T/react`. This would remove the confusion as substrings such as `T/` cannot be entered in any of the fields.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Inaccurate Error Message for Integer Overflow
#### Problem
There are currently 4 types of commands that require internship indices: `edit`, `view` `copy` and `delete-index`.
However, the current implementation of the parsing of these indices does not take into account integer overflows, which is when the integer is too large or too small for InternBuddy to compute.

When trying to parse these integers, it recognises that they are either too large or too small and treats them as not an integer.
As a result, InternBuddy is unable to differentiate between internship index inputs that are not integers and are integer overflows. 

Thus, an invalid command format error message is displayed when these integer overflows are inputted (refer to Figure 25), instead of an index out of range error message when the integer is too large or an invalid index error message when the integer is too small.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dg-int-overflow-problem.png" width="800" />
</p>

   <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 25: Invalid command format error message is returned even though internship index is an integer</p>

<br/>

#### Proposed Design Tweak
We plan to display the invalid index and out of range index error messages even when there is a negative and positive integer overflow respectively.

* When InternBuddy recognises an input as not an integer, we can check if the input begins with the negative sign and is followed by only digits or contains only digits (refer to Figure 26).
   * If the latter is true, there is a negative integer overflow and InternBuddy can be configured to display an invalid index error message (refer to Figure 27).
   * If the former is true, there is a positive integer overflow and InternBuddy can be configured to display an index out of range error message (refer to Figure 28).

## **Appendix D: Effort**
InternBuddy is a brownfield project adapted from
[AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3). Our team morphed it from a contact 
management application to an internship tracker that is designed for Computing undergraduates. Development
took place over 4 sprints which spanned a period of 2-3 months.

### Difficulty Level
For most of our team members, InternBuddy is the first brownfield project that we have undertaken. Dealing
with a large code base is no simple feat. Therefore, our team went with a more conservative approach of
focusing our efforts on refactoring and enhancing existing features to suit our product. This enabled us
to create a functional product at the end of our sprints, with a lower likelihood of encountering bugs.

### Challenges
There are several challenges that we faced during the development phase.
1. **Understanding and Refactoring the Code Base**

   * [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) is a project with around 6k lines of
code. Much effort was required in understanding how the different components (e.g. `Model` and `Logic`)
interact with one another. As our team decided to morph the project, we had to refactor a significant
amount of code.
   * For example, `Person` had to be refactored into `Internship`, and classes like `Phone`
and `Email` were no longer relevant, and we had to transform them into classes like `Role` and `Status`.

2. **Matching of Multiple Fields**
   * The original `find` command in [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) 
     does matching by only one field, `Name`.
   * We wanted to extend the functionality of the `find` command to enable matching by multiple fields.
   * There were many possible options on how to implement it, and we struggled to find an implementation
     that is both simple-to-understand and intuitive to use.
   * We eventually decided on using exact matching and a mix of both OR and AND relationships, as explained
     in the implementation for the [`find`](#find-internships---find) command.
3. **Responsive User Interface**
   * It was challenging to set up the [View Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started) to make it respond
     to both the `view` command and the user interactions with the [List Panel](#setting-up-and-getting-started),
     as programming the GUI is something new to many of us.
   * Furthermore, we had to ensure that the text wraps smoothly when the interface is resized. In other
     words, the wrapping width had to scale with screen size. It took us time to learn how to do it in code,
     and how to adjust our JavaFX components accordingly.
    
### Achievements
Our team is proud to have successfully morphed the project from a contact management application
to an internship tracker. InternBuddy offers a total of 13 different features.
- 3 features that are unmodified from [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) (`list`, `clear`, `exit`).
- 6 features that are modified from [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) (`add`, `edit`, `find`, `delete-index`, `delete-field`, `help`).
- 1 feature that is adapted from [HackNet](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp) (Navigating through Past Commands).
- 3 new features implemented by our team (`view`, `copy`, `upcoming`)

In the area of testing, our team has managed to increase code coverage to [79.55%](https://app.codecov.io/gh/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-3/tp).
This is made possible with GUI testing, where we received help from [AddressBook Level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4)
and [Please Hire Us](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp).

  and [Please Hire Us](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp). We utilised code from these projects to set
  up GUI testing, then added our own test cases to test the UI components that we created ourselves.
* The feature of Navigating Through Past Commands was primarily adapted from  [HackNet](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp),
