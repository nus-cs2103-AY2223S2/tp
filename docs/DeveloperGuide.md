# 2 Design

This section will show our design methodology on the different components and how they interact with each other.

## 2.1 Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.svg" width="280" />
  <br>Figure 1: Architecture Class Diagram
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

### 2.1.1 Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

### 2.1.2 How the architecture components interact with each other

The ***Sequence Diagram*** below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_supplier 1`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg" width="650"/>
  <br>Figure 2: Sequence Diagram (Deleting Person)
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (Reason: to prevent components outside from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ComponentManagers.svg" width="300" />
  <br>Figure 3: Logic Class Diagram
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.<br><br>

## 2.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/ui/Ui.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.svg" />
  <br>Figure 4: UI Class Diagram
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TabPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Order`, `Task` or `Menu` object residing in the `Model`.<br><br>

## 2.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.svg" width="550"/>
  <br>Figure 5: Logic Class Diagram
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackrParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object, which is actually an object of one of its subclasses' (e.g. `AddItemCommand`'s) subclasses (e.g. `AddOrderCommand`). This specific command will then be executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an order).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned by `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_order 1")` API call.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg" />
  <br>Figure 6: Delete Sequence Diagram (Deleting Order)
</p>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

The lifeline for `DeleteOrderCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ParserClasses.svg" width="600"/>
  <br>Figure 7: Parser Class Diagram
</p>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TrackrParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddOrderCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddOrderCommand`) which the `TrackrParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddOrderCommandParser`, `DeleteOrderCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.<br><br>

## 2.4 Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/model/Model.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.svg" width="450" />
  <br>Figure 8: Model Class Diagram
</p>

The `Model` component,

* `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific object (e.g., `Supplier`, `Task`), which are all `Item` objects.
* stores trackr data (all `XYZ` objects which are contained in their respective `UniqueXYZList` object).
* stores currently 'selected' `XYZ` objects (e.g., results of search query) as a **separate filtered list** which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be viewed (e.g. UI is bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### 2.4.1 Item

Here is the `Item` class that is what all model objects depend on.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ItemClassDiagram.svg" width="300" />
  <br>Figure 9: Item Class Diagram
</p>

Each `ItemList` contains a `UniqueItemList` that stores a list of unique `Items`, which are defined by a model definition (e.g., `Supplier` or `Task` from `ModelEnum`).

### 2.4.2 Supplier & Customer

This is the class representation for the `Supplier` and `Customer` class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.svg" width="520" />
  <br>Figure 10: Person Class Diagram
</p>

Here is how `Supplier` and `Customer` works:

* `Supplier` and `Customer` inherit off `Person` class, which depends on the `Item` class.
* Each `Person` contains their name, phone number, deadline, email and _tags_. (e.g., `PersonAddress` represents the address)
* The `Supplier` and `Customer` object have their corresponding `List` and `UniqueList` that stores their information.

### 2.4.3 Task

This is the class representation for the `Task` class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/TaskClassDiagram.svg" width="500" />
  <br>Figure 11: Task Class Diagram
</p>

Here is how `Task` works:

* Each `Task` contains their name, deadline, _status_ and time added (e.g., `TaskName` for task name).
* Each of the attributes inherits off the corresponding `common` classes (e.g., `TaskName` inherit off `Name`).
* The `Task` object have its `List` and `UniqueList`.
* The LocalDateTime object represents the time the task was added to the list (which is used when sorting tasks).

### 2.4.4 Menu

This is the class representation for the `Menu` class.

<p align ="center">
  <img src="images/MenuClassDiagram.svg" width="550" />
  <br>Figure 12: Menu Class Diagram
</p>

Here is how `Menu` works:

* Each `MenuItem` contains their name, selling price, cost and profit (e.g., `ItemName` for menu's item name).
* The `MenuItem`'s `ItemName` attribute inherit off the corresponding `common` classes (e.g., `ItemName` inherit off `Name`).
* The`ItemProfit` is obtained using `ItemSellingPrice` and `ItemCost`(i.e. `ItemProfit` depends on `ItemSellingPrice` and `ItemCost`).
* `ItemSellingPrice` and `ItemCost` class inherits off the `ItemPrice` class.
* The `MenuItem` object have its `List` called `Menu` and `UniqueList`.
* The `MenuItem` is an attribute of `Order`.

**Aspect: Choice to provide a menu package:**

* **Option 1 (our choice):** Separating it into a separate `menu` package.
    * Advantage 1: Ensure that the Order name added is a valid item on the menu, which prevents users from accidentally keying in a wrong order name.
    * Advantage 2: Allows user to see more details of the menu item in a separate tab (e.g. users can see a selling price, cost price and profit for each item)
    * Disadvantage: More time required to implement.

* **Option 2:** Add item name as an attribute in the `Order` class.
  * Advantage: Convenient to implement.
  * Disadvantage: Higher chance of conflicts with another developer working on `Order` class.

### 2.4.5 Order

This is the class representation for the `Order` class.

<p align ="center">
  <img src="images/OrderClassDiagram.svg" width="570" />
  <br>Figure 13: Order Class Diagram
</p>

Here is how `Order` works:

* Each `Order` contains a menu item(from a locally stored menu), customer, quantity, status, deadline and time added (e.g., `OrderStatus` for order's status).
* The menu item and customer each contains attributes as mentioned in their respective section above on how `Menu` and `Customer` works.
* The `Order`'s `OrderDeadline` and `OrderStatus` attribute inherit off the corresponding `common` classes (e.g., `OrderDeadline` inherit off `Deadline`).
* The `Order` object have its `List` called `OrderList` and `UniqueList`.
* The LocalDateTime object represents the time the order was added to the list (which is used when sorting orders).

## 2.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.svg" width="750" />
  <br>Figure 14: Storage Class Diagram
</p>

The `Storage` component,

* can save both Trackr data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TrackrStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `trackr.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3 Implementation

This section describes the details on how the commands are implemented. After every command, the new state of all of Trackr's data is saved into the data file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes about the command format**

* The commands below are in the format `<action><XYZ>Command`.
* `<action>` represents the action the user can do.<br>
  e.g. `add`, `edit`and `find`
* `XYZ` represents the type of data the user can input.<br>
  e.g. `Supplier`, `Order` and `Task`
  * Note: If there are specific instances where `XYZ` represents a limited number of types, it would be stated within the description.

</div>

## 3.1 AddXYZCommand

The `add` command creates a `XYZ` object and adds it into `XYZList` and `FilteredXYZList`. It also saves into the internal `XYZList`, which stores all the `XYZ` objects, that matches the provided keywords.

The keywords that can be provided are the attributes as seen in the corresponding `XYZ`'s class diagram.
For example, `n/` would be followed by a task name for `AddTaskCommand` and supplier name for `AddSupplierCommand`.

The parser for the `add` command would extract out the arguments corresponding to each particular field.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `add` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
  <br>Figure 15: Add Command Activity Diagram
</p>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Information on parameters for add command**

* You can see the specific parameters allowed for [Supplier](UserGuide.md#211-adding-a-supplier-add_supplier), [Order](UserGuide.md#212-adding-an-order-add_order), [Task](UserGuide.md#213-adding-a-task-add_task) and [Menu Item](UserGuide.md#214-adding-a-menu-item-add_item).
* For more information on the specifications of the different attributes, you can look [here](UserGuide.md#61-prefix-summary).

</div>

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `AddXYZCommand` is an improved version of the original AB3 `AddCommand` by implementing into an abstract class - `AddItemCommand`.
This reduces repeated lines of code and improves ease of implementation for future commands that require adding an item to a list.

## 3.2 DeleteXYZCommand

The `delete` command removes a `XYZ` object from internal `FilteredXYZList` and `XYZList`.

The command only accepts 1 argument without any prefixes. The argument corresponds to the index of `XYZ` in the `FilteredXYZList` that the user wishes to delete using a one-based index.

The parser for `delete` command extracts the index found in the arguments. If the argument is valid, then zero-based index is used to remove `XYZ` from the `XYZList`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `delete` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
  <br>Figure 16: Delete Command Activity Diagram
</p>

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `DeleteXYZCommand` is an improved version of the original _AB3_ `DeleteCommand` by implementing into an abstract class - `DeleteItemCommand`.
This reduces repeated lines of code and improves ease of implementation for future commands that require removing an item from a list.

## 3.3 EditXYZCommand

The `edit` command edits a `XYZ` item from the internal `XYZList`.

This command requires user to key in the index of `XYZ` in the `FilteredXYZList` that the user wishes to edit using a one-based index.

The keywords that can be provided are the attributes as seen in the corresponding `XYZ`'s class diagram.
For example, `n/` would be followed by a task name for `AddTaskCommand` and supplier name for `AddSupplierCommand`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Information on parameters for edit command**

* You can see the specific parameters allowed for [Supplier](UserGuide.md#221-editing-a-supplier-edit_supplier), [Order](UserGuide.md#222-editing-an-order-edit_order), [Task](UserGuide.md#223-editing-a-task-edit_task) and [Menu Item](UserGuide.md#224-editing-a-menu-item-edit_item).
* For more information on the specifications of the different attributes, you can look [here](UserGuide.md#61-prefix-summary).

</div>

The user is required to key in at least one keyword to be edited.

The parser for `edit` command parses and extracts out the arguments corresponding to each particular field.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `edit` command. 
(The rake symbol used in the Figure 17: Edit Command Activity Diagram has been implemented with reference to [this forum](https://forum.plantuml.net/195/is-there-any-support-for-subactivity-or-the-rake-symbol).)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/EditItemXYZRakeActivityDiagram.svg" width="500" />
  <br>Figure 18: Edit Item XYZ Activity Diagram
</p>

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `EditXYZCommand` is an improved version of the original _AB3_ `EditCommand` by implementing into an abstract class - `EditItemCommand`.
This reduces repeated lines of code and improves ease of implementation for future commands that require editing an item in a list.

## 3.4 FindXYZCommand

The `find` command finds `XYZ` objects from the internal `XYZList` (which stores all the `XYZ` objects) that matches the provided keywords.

The keywords that can be provided varies for each command and can be found in the user guide.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Information on parameters for add command**

* You can see the specific parameters allowed for [Supplier](UserGuide.md#231-finding-a-supplier-find_supplier), [Order](UserGuide.md#232-finding-an-order-find_order), [Task](UserGuide.md#233-finding-a-task-find_task) and [Menu Item](UserGuide.md#234-finding-a-menu-item-find_item).
* For more information on the specifications of the different attributes, you can look [here](UserGuide.md#61-prefix-summary).

</div>

The parser for the `find` command would extract out the arguments corresponding to each particular field.

A `XYZContainsKeywordPredicate` is built upon these fields, which is used to test each `XYZ` object in the `XYZList` on whether they match the keywords provided.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `find` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
  <br>Figure 19: Find Command Activity Diagram
</p>

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `FindXYZCommand` is an improved version of the original _AB3_ `FindCommand` by implementing into an abstract class - `FindItemCommand`.
This reduces repeated lines of code and improves ease of implementation for future commands that require finding an item in a list.

The abstract class `ItemDescriptor` stores the details of an item. It provides easier implementation for `XYZContainsKeywordPredicate` classes.

## 3.5 ListXYZCommand

The `list` command retrieves all the `XYZ` objects from the `XYZList` and lists them all in the internal `FilteredXYZList`.

The `FilteredXYZList` is then updated to have all `XYZ` objects, after which it will then to shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `list` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ListCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
  <br>Figure 20: List Command Activity Diagram
</p>

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `ListXYZCommand` is an improved version of the original _AB3_ `ListCommand` by implementing into an abstract class - `ListItemCommand`.
This reduces repeated lines of code and improves ease of implementation for future commands that require listing all item of the same data type.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3.6 SortXYZCommand

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Information on `XYZ`**

* `XYZ` for `sort` only refers to tasks and orders.

</div>

The `sort` command sorts `XYZ` objects in the internal `FilteredXYZList` according to a selected criteria.

The command only accepts 1 argument without the prefix `c/`. This argument is optional, and it corresponds to the criteria the user wishes to sort the list by.

The parser for the `sort` command would extract out the criteria. If no criteria is given, it will be defaulted to `Status and Deadline`.

A `SortXYZComparator` is used to define how two `XYZ` objects should be compared and sorted.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `sort` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
  <br>Figure 21: Sort Command Activity Diagram
</p>

**Why is it implemented this way**

Unlike the other commands, the `SortXYZCommand` does not implement an abstract class like `SortItemCommand`.
It simply extends Command as there are only two sort commands (one for orders and one for tasks).

Although abstracting out an abstract class would ease implementation for future sort commands, it is not currently planned.
However, this might be changed in the future to follow the syntax of the other commands.

## 3.7 ClearXYZCommand

The `clear` command removes **all** `XYZ` object from internal `FilteredXYZList` and `XYZList`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `delete` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
  <br>Figure 22: Clear Command Activity Diagram
</p>

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `ClearXYZCommand` is an improved version of the original _AB3_ `ClearCommand` by implementing into an abstract class - `ClearItemCommand`.
This reduces repeated lines of code and improves ease of implementation for future commands that require clearing all item from the list.

## 3.8 TabCommand

`TabCommand` switches tabs on the application through CLI commnads. The user can switch tabs with the `TabCommand` or any of `ListXYZCommand` or `FindXYZCommand` which brings the user to the relevant `XYZ` tab.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `tab` command.

**Why is it implemented this way**

An `Observable` property of `JavaFx` is used so that an `ObservableTabIndex` class can be created. This reduces the coupling between `Logic` which executes the command and `Ui` components. The `Ui` listens for changes in the `ObservableTabIndex`. As `Ui` is only aware of `ObservableTabIndex` but not `Logic`, this also enforces principle of least knowledge.

## 3.9 HelpCommand

The `help` command brings up a [HelpWindow](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/ui/HelpWindow.java), where there is a link to the User Guide of Trackr. The user can also press `F1` or click `Help` the menu bar to bring it up.

This will allow the users to be able to have a reference to all the commands and explanation within a single webpage.

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `HelpCommand` is the same original command as from _AB3_, just with the link updated to this project.

## 3.10 ExitCommand

The `exit` command allows the users to exit Trackr via the command line.

**Why is it implemented this way**

The `ExitCommand` is the same original command as from _AB3_.

## 4.2 Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Tech-savvy home businesses owners who:
  * lists their products online or on their own website
  * perform transactions manually without a Point-of-Sale (POS) system
  * Lack manpower/ time to track orders and contacts manually
  * Has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Our application:

* allows for consolidation of orders, contacts & tasks information which makes it easier to manage them. (but no _real-time automation_)
* serves as a user-friendly alternative to free applications such as Microsoft Excel which may not be catered to their needs and requires tedious formatting. (but no support for custom formatting of interface)
* enables faster contact management compared to a typical mouse/GUI driven app<br><br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.7 Planned Enhancements

**1.** Ensure all the commands follow the standard format so that it is easier for the user to remember.<br>
Currently, some commands do not follow the standard format which requires a prefix in front of each parameter. 
For instance, `find_supplier` is of the format `find_supplier NAME` instead of `find_supplier n/NAME`.<br>
The format is shown below.
  <div style="background-color:silver; font-weight:bold">
   <span style="color:darkblue">&lt;command&gt;</span>
   <span> </span>
   <span style="color:indigo">&lt;index&gt;</span>
   <span> </span>
   <span style="color:brown">&lt;prefix/paramater&gt; &lt;prefix/paramater&gt; ...</span>
  </div>
  <br>

**2.** Provide better success messages for edit commands.<br>
Currently, the edit commands shows ambiguous success or error messages to the user.<br>
For example editing a task return the success message, `Edited task: task`. 
We suggest a clearer and more comprehensive message such as `Edited task: <TASK DATA>` where `<TASK DATA>` represents the edited data.<br>
Specifically, `Edited task: Buy eggs; Deadline:01 January 2023; Status: Not Done`.

Proposed implementation: 
Currently, all the EditXYZCommand extends from the EditItemCommand and uses the success message format (`Edited %s: %1$s`) defined in EditItemCommand class.
When an edit command is executed successfully, we generate the success message by replacing `%s` with the item type and `%1$s` with the string representation of the edited item object.
We plan to change the format of the success message (by replacing `%1$s` to `%s`) to print out the entire string of <TASK DATA> instead of only printing out the first word which is the item name.

**3.** Fix error messages for commands.<br>
Currently, some commands have an issue with their error message.<br>
For example, if there is a duplicate from this command `add_order on/Chocolate Cookies q/10 d/10/10/2023 n/Ben p/11111111 a/Ben Street`, 
the error message should be `This Order already exists in the order list`. 
However, currently, this error message is shown instead: `This Order already exists in the Chocolate Cookies; 10; Deadline: 10 October 2023; Status: Not Delivered; Customer: Ben; Phone: 11111111; Address: Ben Street list`.

**4.** Improve validity checks for menu item's `PRICE` and `COST`.<br>
Currently, there is no comprehensive validity check for these two parameters, which might result in bugs shown within the application.<br>
Both `ItemSellingPrice` class (which represents the `PRICE` and `ItemCost` class (representing the `COST`) extends from the `ItemPrice` class (as seen in this [Class Diagram](#244-menu)).
Thus, both `PRICE` and `COST` are checked with the same `ItemPrice::isValidPrice(String)` method.
We plan to improve on this feature flaw by modifying this `isValidPrice(String)` method to check and limit the price and cost entered to be `1000` or less, 
so as to prevent a situation where an issue with the calculation occurs when excessively large numbers are keyed in.

**5.** Improve validity check for order's and task's `DEADLINE`.<br>
Currently, the validity check for deadlines is not strict enough.
For example, users are able to enter deadlines that are far away in the past like `01/01/1800`.
Therefore, we plan to improve on this by only allowing users to key in deadlines that falls within the past 10 years.
Since both `OrderDeadline` and `TaskDeadline` extends the common class `Deadline` and `Deadline::isValidDeadline` is used to check the validity of both parameters,
we plan to simply tweak the implementation of `Deadline::isValidDeadline` for stricter checks on deadlines entered.

**6.** Fix error in `find_order`.
Currently, `find_order` only works on the last field that is typed into the command. Hence, it is ignoring the other fields.
We plan to improve this feature to match `find_task` command where it would match the multiple fields if they are present in an `AND` format.
Specifically, `find_order q/2 d/01/01/2024` would list all orders that have quantity of `2` and a deadline of `01/01/2024`.
