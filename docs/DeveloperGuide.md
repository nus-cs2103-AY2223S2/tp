## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Product Overview

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, such as work overload
among subordinates, difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees, and time-consuming manual
tasks like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates’ workloads, allowing
managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised manner.

### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### 2.1.1 Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for, </br> At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other. </br> At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.
[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#26-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

#### 2.1.2 How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `deletep 1` to delete the person at index 1.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `deletet 1` to delete the task at index 1.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramTwo.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (excluding OfficeConnectModel), defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component. implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given
component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled
to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/OfficeComponentManagers.png" width="750" />

As can be seen from the diagram above, OfficeConnectModel is instead a class that contains two repository model managers, one used 
to keep track of tasks (i.e. `Task` objects) and the other used to keep track of the assignment of tasks to persons (i.e `AssignTask` objects).

### 2.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml`
files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
executes user commands using the `Logic` component. listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data. keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands. depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 2.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
3. executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command can communicate with the `Model` or `OfficeConnectModel` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person or
5. add a task or add an assignment).
6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletep 1")`
API call, which deletes the person located at index one.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletep 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an 
`XYZCommandParser`(`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the 
other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the 
`AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object. All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, 
`DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 2.4 Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Model` component 
* Stores the address book data for persons i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object). 
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list,
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. 
the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes. 
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a`ReadOnlyUserPref` 
object. 
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP)
model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook`
to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### 2.5 OfficeConnectModel component

**API** : [`OfficeConnectModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/OfficeConnectModel.java)

<img src="images/OfficeConnectModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

* Stores the task list data and taskAssignment data i.e., all `task` and `assignTask` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueItemList` object). 
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Task` and `AssignTask` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list 
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` and `ObservableList<AssignTask>` that can be 
'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. 
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `OfficeConnectModel` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### 2.6 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

Original AddressBook Storage Component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

OfficeConnect Storage Component

<img src="images/OfficeStorageClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

The initial storage component was specifically designed to accommodate the address book model. However, OfficeConnect
necessitates the inclusion of two additional storage types, namely task storage and assignment storage.

To address this requirement, a new generic class called RepositoryStorage has been introduced to the storage component.
This addition allows for increased extensibility and flexibility in the storage component's functionality.

The enhanced design is extendable and also capable of supporting the integration of additional databases into the
application in the future, if required.

The `Storage` component saves address book data, task list data, task assignment data and user preference data in json format 
and reads them back into corresponding objects. It inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which 
means it can be treated as either (if the functionality of only one is needed). It depends on some classes in the `Model`
and `OfficeConnectModel` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to `Model` and `OfficeConnectModel`)

### 2.7 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
Notation: inputs placed in closed brackets [] are optional.

### 3.1 Adding a task
Syntax: `addt t/TITLE [c/CONTENT] [st/STATUS]`  
Purpose: Allows users to add tasks into OfficeConnect.

#### 3.1.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `AddTaskCommand` and `AddTaskCommandParser`.
Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates how a user adds new tasks into OfficeConnect.  

![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 3.1.2 Design Considerations
**Aspect: Format of inputs in Add Task Command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only title is required when creating a task. The other fields are optional.
  * Pros: As users may not have a content or status in mind when creating new tasks, this alternative allows flexibility
    in user input, which makes the app more user-friendly. Some tasks may also be self-explanatory and thus do not
    require content descriptions.
  * Cons: More difficult to implement, more likely to cause bugs.

* **Alternative 2:** Require all fields to be compulsory
  * Pros: Easier to implement, fewer bugs may be generated.
  * Cons: Less intuitive and less user-friendly, as users who might not have a content description in mind when
    creating tasks may be forced to key in random content to add tasks.

#### 3.1.3 Constraints:
**Title must be unique:**  
We felt that the title should be unique as it improves organisation and visual clarity for the user. By mandating unique
titles, we encourage users to be specific in the title(purpose) of the task (e.g. they will set title as
"Complete slides for Mr X" rather than "Complete Slides"), which will benefit them greatly, as they will be
able to clearly distinguish the purpose of each task just by looking at the title.  
Suppose that the title was not unique. Users might have many tasks with the same title, which would impair their ability
to distinguish between the tasks unless they read each of the task content individually. It would also impair visual
clarity when searching for tasks, as tasks with similar titles might clutter up the GUI.
Hence, our approach in mandating unique titles are geared towards improving organisation and visual clarity for users in
both the short and long term.

### 3.2 Deleting a task
Syntax: `deletet INDEX`  
Purpose: Allows users to delete the task at the specified index in OfficeConnect.

#### 3.2.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `ListTaskCommand`, `DeleteTaskCommand` and `DeleteTaskCommandParser`.
Below are the steps required to delete a task in OfficeConnect.  

Step 1: User keys in `listt`, which will display the index of all tasks.
The user can thus obtain the index of the task that they want to delete.

Step 2: User keys in `deletet INDEX` to delete the task at the specified index.
If the index is invalid, an error will be thrown.

Below is an activity diagram showcasing the 2 steps:  
![DeleteTaskActivityDiagram](images/DeleteTaskActivityDiagram.png)

#### 3.2.2 Design Considerations
**Aspect: Implementation of Delete Task Command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users have to call `listt` to find the index of the task they wish to delete.
  * Pros: Increase convenience for users, as they do not have to remember the index of each task while being easier to implement.
  * Cons: Increases coupling within OfficeConnectModel, as any bug with `listt` could render users incapable of
    obtaining the index needed for `deletet`.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to key in the index of each task when creating tasks, after which they can
  use this index when deleting tasks
  * Pros: If the user remembers the index of each task, they will not need to call `listt`. Hence, it will be less
    troublesome for them to delete tasks as the number of steps required is reduced by one.
    Also reduces coupling, as `deletet` will not have to depend on `listt` to function properly.
  * Cons: The cons of this alternative lies in the difficulty of managing indexes when adding and deleting tasks.  
    If the user does not keep track of the indexes they have used for previous tasks, they may have to still
    call `listt` to find the index of the task they wish to delete or to find unused indexes to add tasks, which will not
    give it an advantage over the first alternative.  
    It would also be harder to keep track of invalid indexes. When tasks are deleted, their index should be invalid. Using
    this alternative, we would have to constantly update a list of invalid indexes when adding or deleting tasks, which
    would be troublesome and could lead to bugs. In alternative 1, all indexes are flushed to the front (i.e. first task
    has index 1, second task has index 2 etc.) and thus the invalid indexes can be easily obtained.
  
### 3.3 Find a Person's Assigned Task
Syntax: `findp NAME`  
Purpose: Allow users to search and review the list of tasks assigned to the specified person in OfficeConnect.

#### 3.3.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser`.

Below is an activity diagram that illustrates the control flow for the Find feature.  

![FindTaskActivitySequenceDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

### 3.4 Find a Task's Assignees
Syntax: `findt TASKNAME` </br>
Purpose: Allow users to search and review the group of individuals assigned to the specified task in OfficeConnect.

#### 3.4.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `FindTaskCommand` and `FindTaskCommandParser`.

Below is an activity diagram that illustrates how a user finds who are assigned to a task. </br>

![FindTaskActivitySequenceDiagram](images/FindTaskActivitySequenceDiagram.png)

#### 3.4.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Form of query**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Query using TASK_TITLE
    * Pros: More intuitive as users do not have to keep track of the list index of the tasks.
      Able to query for tasks that are already logged in OfficeConnect using the title of the task.
    * Cons: Length of commands are dependent on length of title. Users have to remember the name of the tasks.

* **Alternative 2:** Query using INDEX
    * Pros: Shorter command to type out.
    * Cons: Less intuitive and less user-friendly. Users would be forced to list all the tasks before being able
      to execute the findt command if the current display is empty.

### 3.5 Edit a Task
Syntax: `editt INDEX title/TITLE c/CONTENT st/STATUS` </br>
Purpose: Allow users to edit tasks that are currently listed in OfficeConnect.

#### 3.5.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `EditTaskCommand` and `EditTaskCommandParser`.

### 3.6 Assign a Task
Syntax: `assign pi/INDEX ti/INDEX` </br>
Purpose: Allows users to assign a person to a task in OfficeConnect.

#### 3.6.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `AssignCommand`, `AssignCommandParser`, `ListCommand`,
`ListTaskCommand`, `ListAllCommand`, `FindCommand` and `FindTaskCommand`. Below are the steps required to assign a task
to a person in OfficeConnect. </br>

Step 1: User executes `listall` to list all the people and tasks in OfficeConnect.
* Alternative steps to Step 1:
  * Step 1.1: User executes `listp` to list all persons or `findp David` to search for David in the contact
    list.
  * Step 1.2: User executes `listt` to list all the tasks or `findt slides` to search for a task containing the
    word slides in its title.
* After this step, the target task to assign and the target person to be assigned to said task will appear in the list
  of persons and tasks displayed.

Step 2: User executes `assign pi/1 ti/1` to assign the first task on the list of tasks to the first person on the list
of tasks.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to execute an `assign` command:
![Assign Activity Diagram](images/AssignActivityDiagram.png)

#### 3.6.2 Design Considerations
**Aspect: Steps Leading to Execution of Assign Command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users execute `listp` or `findp` to display a list of persons and `listt` or
  `findt` to display a list of tasks on the application.
  * Pros: Users can search for a specific person or task before assigning.
  * Cons: If `listp` and `listt` are used, users may have to scroll through a long list to search for the desired
    person or task. The results of `findp` and `findt` cannot be displayed simultaneously. Thus, if `findp` was executed
    to search for a person, the user will then have to execute `listt` to access the full list of tasks in order to
    identify the task that the user wants to be assigned to that person.

* **Alternative 2 (proposed additional choice):** Users can execute a command to display a list tasks that have not been
  assigned to any person or to display a people that have not been assigned to that task.
  * Pros: Users can easily view all the tasks that are currently unassigned at the same time, instead of having to execute
    `findt` to search for unassigned tasks one at a time.
  * Cons: None, because this is an additional feature proposed that will complement Alternative 1.

### 3.7 Help Window

Syntax: `help`
<br>
Purpose: Provides users with a bird's eye view of the various methods usable in OfficeConnect.

#### 3.7.1 Implementation

This window was made by the `HelpWindow` class, which ties in its respective `fxml` and `css` files to display the relevant UI to the user.
To provide the instructions to the user, a `HelpStrings` class is maintained to give instructions stored in lengthy strings.

A Help Window will be opened either by entering the `help` command, or by clicking on "Help" button in the toolbar.
The Activity Diagram below details the workflow of a user who wishes to access the HelpWindow. If the Help Window does not provide enough
information, the user can choose to view the comprehensive User Guide instead.

<img src="images/HelpActivityDiagram.png" width="330" />

#### 3.7.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Contents of help window**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Display as a separate window, with concise details included in the sheet.
    * Pros: Serves as a quick reference for the user, without having to go online to view the full comprehensive User Guide.
    * Cons: Major updates in command implementations will have to be updated in the help sheet too, in addition to the online User Guide.

* **Alternative 2:** Provide the user with the link to access the online User Guide.
    * Pros: More comprehensive, able to give user the complete detailing of each command.
    * Cons: Troublesome, requires user to go online to view the User Guide. User may also be overwhelmed by length of guide.

**Aspect: Viewing of various command instructions**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Display all executable commands in a hierarchical tree, with description of method selected in a separate area.
    * Pros: Providing a hierarchical structure to the list of commands available. This provides users with more ease of visualising the various methods as different groups of commands.
    * Cons: More complex structures to be used when implementing the Ui of the help window. Restructuring of tree also may be necessary when big changes are made to structure of commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Display all executable commands in a list.
    * Pros: Adding/Restructuring of commands only involves deleting/modifying the line the command is on, no restructuring of the list needed
    * Cons: Design not too intuitive, user may need to eyeball through all the commands in order to find what he/she is looking for.

<br>

### 3.8 Unassigning a Task from a Person

Syntax: `unassign pi/PERSON_INDEX ti/TASK_INDEX`  
Purpose: Allows users to unassign a task from a person in OfficeConnect.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/UnassignActivity.png" width="550" />

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates how a user unassign a tasks from a person in the OfficeConnectModel. 

![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/UnassignSequenceDiagram.png)
#### 3.8.1 Implementation

The implementation of this feature is supported by `UnassignTaskCommand` and `UnassignTaskCommandParser`.

#### 3.8.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Unassigning a task from a person**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Unassign tasks using the index of the person and the index of the task.
    - Pros: Easier for users to locate the task and person they want to unassign, especially if the list of tasks or persons is long.
    - Cons: Requires users to first obtain the index of the task and person by listing them, which might increase the steps required for the user.

- **Alternative 2:** Unassign tasks using the task title and person name.
    - Pros: No need to obtain the index of the task and person, which could reduce the steps required for the user.
    - Cons: Task titles and person names might be long, making it more difficult for users to input the command. There could also be issues with names that are not unique.

### 3.9 List all tasks
Syntax: `listt`  
Purpose: Displays all tasks stored in OfficeConnect.

#### 3.9.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `OfficeConnectModel`.
Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates how a user can see all tasks stored in OfficeConnect.

![ListTaskSequenceDiagram](images/ListTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

### 3.10 Filter persons according to tag
Syntax: `filter t/TAG`  
Purpose: Allows users to find all persons with the specified tag

#### 3.10.1 Implementation
The implementation of this feature is supported by `FilterCommand` and `FilterCommandParser`.
Below is an activity diagram that illustrates how a user finds all persons with the specified tag.

![FilterTaskActivityDiagram](images/FilterTaskActivityDiagram.png)

#### 3.10.2 Design Considerations
**Aspect: Number of tags that users can input**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only one tag is allowed.
  * Pros: Encourage users to be specific in the tag they are searching for. Easier implementation.
  * Cons: Users will have to use the command as many times as the number of tags they want to search.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow multiple tags
  * Pros: Allows users to search for more than one tag at once, which increases convenience and flexibility.
  * Cons: Could produce many search results which may clutter up the GUI (as opposed to searching for only one task). More prone to bugs.

### 3.11 Quickstart Window
Syntax: `quickstart`  
Purpose: Allows new users to better understand how OfficeConnect works.

#### 3.11.1 Implementation
Similar to Help Window in section 3.7, this window is maintained by `QuickstartWindow` class, which also maintains 
similarly named `fxml` and `css` to display the relevant quickstart information.

Users will be shown a guide
