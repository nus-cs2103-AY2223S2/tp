### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultron/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultron/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultron/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `OpeningListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultron/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Opening` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultron/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `UltronParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an opening).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `UltronParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `UltronParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultron/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores Ultron data i.e., all `Opening` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueOpeningList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Opening` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Opening>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<!-- <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Ultron`, which `Opening` references. This allows `Ultron` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Opening` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div> -->

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultron/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both Ultron data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `UltronStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ultron.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add remark feature

The `RemarkCommandParser` class parses the user input and returns a `RemarkCommand` object. The `RemarkCommand` object then accesses the `Model` component to get its filteredOpenings.

The `RemarkCommand` object accesses the filteredOpenings to get the opening at the specified index. It then uses the details of the retrieved opening along with a new remark to create a new opening.

![UI Interaction for the `remark 1 r/2 OAs` Command](images/RemarkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `RemarkCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The `RemarkCommand` object then calls `setOpening()` on `Model`, passing in the openingToEdit and editedOpening. The `Model` will then set the opening at the index specified to be the editedOpening.

Once the opening in the model has been changed, the result indicating the command's success will be returned to `LogicManager` and `MainWindow`

### Show opening details feature

The `show` command was outlined with existing commands which take in indexes. It is similar to both the `delete` and `edit` commands, accessing the displayed list in  the `Model` component.

The `ShowCommandParser` class parses the user input and returns a `ShowCommand` object. The `ShowCommand` object then accesses the `Model` component to get the opening at the specified index from the openings list.

![UI Interaction for the `show 1` Command](images/ShowSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ShowCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

An `Index` is tracked by the model component and updated on every `ShowCommand` execution. A `CommandResult` object is then returned to the `LogicManager`.

The `MainWindow` class then receives the `CommandResult` object and calls the handler `handleShow`. The method gets the opening at the specified index from the `LogicManager` which in turn accesses the `ModelManager`.

A new `OpeningDetailsPanel` is created and displayed to the user. The `OpeningDetailsPanel` is a `UiPart` which is a `JavaFX` component. The `OpeningDetailsPanel` is created with the retrieved opening.

A simplified sequence was employed for mouse clicks. The `OpeningListPanel` class handles the mouse click event and calls the logic component to set the selected opening. The `MainWindow` class then calls the `handleShow` method to recreate the `OpeningDetailsPanel` with the selected opening.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect:** How show command executes:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Access the opening at the specified index from the displayed list in the `Model` component.
    * Pros:
      * Easy to implement.
      * Meets the basic requirement of the feature.
      * Simple to understand.
    * Cons: May not be very useful if the user wants to see the details of an opening that is not displayed in the current list.
* **Alternative 2:** Access the opening at the specified index from the full list in the `Model` component.
    * Pros:
      * More useful as the user can see the details of any opening in Ultron.
      * Flexible usage.
      * Follows the `find` command which also accesses the full list.
    * Cons: We must ensure that the index is still valid even if the list is filtered or sorted, which may be difficult to implement.

### Upcoming keydates feature
<!-- Anton, Alex -->
Implementation

The `upcoming` feature takes in a positive integer as the argument. This integer represents the number of days to consider, excluding today. The feature will filter openings based on whether their keydate falls between today and the specified number of days in the future, including today. It also filters out openings without any keydates.

Given below is an example usage scenario and ow the upcoming feature's mechanisms behaves in steps.

Step 1. The user launches the application with pre-existing openings added, each with certain keydates, such as `Interview: 2023-10-10`. The user decides to only want to focus on openings that has key events coming up in the next 5 days. The user executes `upcoming 5` to filter the openings to only show openings with keydates within 5 days.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the command fails the execution, the list will not be updated and remain unchanged.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the status operation works:

![UI Interaction for the `upcoming 5` Command](images/UpcomingSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 2. The `UltronParser` class parses the user input of `upcoming 5` and returns a `UpcomingCommand` object with a `OpeningsBeforeDaysPredicate` representing the `5` portion of the input.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` of the `UpcomingCommand` object, which accesses the `Model` component to update the current list of openings to be displayed. This new list will be filtered based on the `OpeningsBeforeDaysPredicate`, checking through the full list of openings for openings within `5` days.

Step 4. The `MainWindow` class receives the `CommandResult` object and the new filtered list is displayed for the user.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Allow for inputs in months, weeks and days rather than days**

* The benefit to split inputs might not be so apparent since users would usually only use this command nearer to the event dates. 


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow only input in terms of days.
    * Pros:
        * Easier to implement.
        * Efficient for users since they usually want to look for events close to the current date. 
    * Cons:
        * Less efficient if users want to find events which are further into the future. 


* **Alternative 2:** Allow for input in terms of months, weeks and days.
    * Pros:
        * Users can give inputs without converting the period to days. 
    * Cons:
        * Increased complexity in terms of parsing
        * Longer command line with more fields increases the amount the user has to type to use the command. 

![UI Interaction for the `upcoming 5` Command](images/UpcomingSequenceDiagram.png)

### Status filtering feature

Implementation

The `status` feature command was outlined with an existing command which takes in keywords. It is similar to the `find` command, filtering based on the full list in  the `Ultron` component. Unlike `find`, it only accepts one keyword at a time.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the status feature's mechanisms behaves in steps.

Step 1. The user launches the application with pre-existing openings added, each with different status values, such as `APPLIED` or `INTERVIEWING`. The user decides to only want to focus on openings that he has only just applied to. The user executes `status applied` to filter the openings to only show openings with `APPLIED` status.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the command fails the execution, the list will not be updated and remain unchanged.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the status operation works:

![UI Interaction for the `status applied` Command](images/StatusSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `StatusCommand` and `ContainsStatusPredicate` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 2. The `UltronParser` class parses the user input of `status applied` and returns a `StatusCommand` object with a `ContainsStatusPredicate` representing the `applied` portion of the input.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` of the `StatusCommand` object, which accesses the `Model` component to update the current list of openings to be displayed. This new list will be filtered based on the `ContainsStatusPredicate`, checking through the full list of openings for openings with the status `APPLIED`.

Step 4. The `MainWindow` class receives the `CommandResult` object and the new filtered list is displayed for the user.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How many keywords status command allows:**

* There is not much benefit to allowing more than one keyword at a time and users can avoid needless clutter.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow one keyword.
    * Pros:
      * Easier to implement.
      * Largely meets needs of users in a typical setting.
      * Users can avoid needless clutter.
    * Cons:
      * Less flexibility for user if they ever want to filter based on two keywords.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow one or more keywords.
    * Pros:
      * More flexibility for user.
    * Cons:
      * Increased complexity in terms of parsing, validation and logic.
      * Need to add-on sorting functionality to sort filtered openings by status to prevent disorganisation.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of internship applications
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage openings faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Evaluation of Implementation

This table summarises the difficulty level and effectiveness of each feature on a scale of 1 to 5.

| **Feature** | **Difficulty** | **Effectiveness** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keydates | 3 | 5 |
| Keydate sorting | 3 | 4 |
| Status command | 2 | 3 |
| Remark | 1 | 2 |
| Upcoming command | 4 | 4 |
| UI enhancements | 4 | 3 |

### Difficulties faced

1. Keydates

   1. Keydates were implemented using the existing 'Tag' class as a baseline. Refactoring was done to both the 'Tag' model and 'TagParser' to allow for the creation of keydates.

   2. There were more issues with the 'Tag' model than expected, since the key and date had to be further extracted from the input arguments. This lead to multiple separator characters being tested out before settling on the current implementation. The tokenisation of the input arguments was also haphazardly inserted, since the alternative would require a complete overhaul of the 'ArgumentTokenizer' class.

   3. Input validation was often overlooked and only discovered during testing. Empty or untrimmed keys were initially accepted and dates were not checked for validity. This was fixed by adding additional checks in the parser.

   4. Date validation for certain invalid dates in our keydates, such as 29 February in a non-leap year or 31 November, was missed out due to not realising our implementation would not account for it. Initial implementations of date validation using LocalDate and DateTimeFormatter does not check for such invalid dates. Afterwards, we had find a new method of parsing and validation in the form of SimpleDateFormat that sufficiently validates input dates.

2. Sorting of keydates

   1. The initial collection of keydates was implemented using a HashSet, which does not allow for ordering. This was changed an ArrayList, which allowed for ordering of keydates. There are further issues with the logic component and its use of a filtered list which we eventually identified and replaced with an observable list.

   2. Comparison of keydates was initially implemented with a custom comparator. This was changed to implementing the 'Comparable' interface and defining a 'compareTo' method, which allowed for the sorting of keydates to be done in the 'Keydate' class itself.

3. Status command

   1. The status command was rather straightforward and made use of existing Predicate classes. The only issue was the lack of a 'Status' class, which was rectified by creating a new class.

4. Remark command

   1. The existing implementation from our team project tutorial was used as a baseline. Minor changes were made hence did not pose any major issues.

5. Upcoming command

   1. This command required the most effort to implement. The initial proposal was to have a sorting command and an upcoming command, but this was changed to a single upcoming command.

   2. A opening predicate and a opening comparator had to be implemented for the two-step process of filtering and sorting

6. UI enhancements

   1. The initial list view limited the amount of information that could be displayed. A details panel was added to display more information about the opening.

   2. This required restructuring of the UI components and the logic components. The logic components had to be modified to allow for the details panel to be updated when a new opening is selected.

### Achievements

A large part of the project was spent on refactoring the codebase and ensuring practical design. Many features were remade after testing and discussion concluded that the current implementation was not ideal. We also invested significant time into improving the UI, which was not a requirement of the project.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### **Enhancement 1: Optional Contact Field**

1. The current email field for each opening is not optional. This is not ideal as some openings do not require an email address and users may find it inconvenient to have to enter a dummy email address. An email address might also not be the most appropriate contact information for some openings.

2. We propose to replace the email field with an optional contact field. This field can be used to store any contact information, e.g. phone number, email address, LinkedIn profile link, career portal link. This will allow users to store any contact information they wish to have for each opening.

### **Enhancement 2: Keydates should accept time**

1. The current keydate field that can be added to openings only accept dates in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. This means that users cannot add the time of deadlines to keydates. For example, a user might want to include the time of his interview in the keydate.

2. We propose to include the option for keydates to include a time. The format for a keydate, which used to be "Event@YYYY-MM-DD", will now become "Event@YYYY-MM-DD[hh:mm]" Adding a time to a keydate will not be compulsory, meaning that users can continue to add keydates without a timing.

### **Enhancement 3: Position should allow for special characters**

1. The current position field that can be added to openings only accept positions that are alphanumeric with whitespace. This means that users cannot add special characters to their position. For example, a user might want to add a position for `UI/UX designer`.

2. We propose to add additional parsing functionality to allow users to include special characters in the position field when adding or editing an opening, like `edit 1 p/UI/UX designer`. We will also need to adjust our parsing for our prefixes such as `p/`, such that it does not introduce any bugs when the field value also includes the special character `/`.

### **Enhancement 4: Addition of keydates should be accumulative**

1. The current keydates field can be changed using the `edit` command. This change overwrites the current keydates of the opening being edited. This means that users have to re-enter every single past keydate when adding a new one to maintain the history. For example, a user might already have a keydate `OA@2023-11-11` and wants to add `Interview@2023-11-13`, the user will have to enter the command `edit 1 d/OA@2023-11-11 d/Interview@2023-11-13`.

2. We propose to allow edit to still overwrite the keydates, but we add new commands `addkeydate` and `deletekeydate`. These two commands will take in an index and keydates as parameters to add new keydates or delete existing keydates for the indexed opening. Example usages would be `addkeydate 1 Interview@2023-11-13` and `deletekeydate 1 OA@2023-11-11`. It will also be able to take in multiple keydates and function accordingly (all input keydates for `deletekeydate` must be valid, ie if one of them do not exist, command fails).
