## PowerConnect Developer Guide

PowerConnect is a fully customized offline application for tuition and school teachers to manage students' and parents' administrative details. While it has limited features at this stage, plans for future PowerConnect releases to update features and usage capabilities have been made with detailed timeline.
The aim of this product is to eventually be a useful tool that is used in conjunction with Learning Management System (LMS) tools currently in the market to aid teachers in managing students. <br>

PowerConnect is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). PowerConnect helps teachers in tracking and updating students' particulars.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `student delete in/13`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<a name = "ui-component"/>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java).

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, as `UI` relies on `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on classes in `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in `Model`.

<a name = "logic-component"/>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `PowerConnectParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `StudentAddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `student delete command` & `parent/NOK delete command`.

**Sequence Diagram for Student Delete Command**
![Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `Student Delete` Command](images/StudentDeleteSequentialDiagram.png)

**Sequence Diagram for Parent/NOK Delete Command**
![Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `Parent/NOK Delete` Command](images/ParentDeleteSequentialDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PowerConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `StudentAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `StudentAddCommand`) which the `PowerConnectParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `StudentAddCommandParser`, `StudentDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<a name = "model-component"/>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<a name = "storage-component"/>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StoragePowerConnect.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both PowerConnect data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PowerConnectStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<a name = "delete-student/parent-feature"/>

## Delete student/parent feature

### Current Implementation
PowerConnect allows users to delete a:
* Student from `UniqueStudentList` of `Class` using their class and index number.
* Parent from `UniqueParentList` of `Parents` using their name and phone number.

However, a parent can only be deleted if no student is attached to that parent.

#### General Flow for deleting a student and the parent for that student

1. The user launches the application and wants to delete a student, `Bernice`, and her parent, `Bob`, who are already stored inside.
2. The user tries deleting the parent first using `parent delete n/Bob pnP/91234567`.
3. PowerConnect displays an error saying `"The parent you are trying to delete has a student attached! You can't delete the parent!"`.
4. The user then tries to delete that student using `student 1A delete in/1`.
5. `PowerConnectParser` and `StudentCommandParser` will check if command format provided by the user is valid before `StudentDeleteCommand#execute()` is called.
6. PowerConnect will check if the student to be deleted exists in `UniqueStudentList` of `Class`. 
7. If the student exists, PowerConnect will then check if the parent of the student to be deleted exists.
8. If the parent exists, the student will be deleted and their parent will be updated.
9. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned to `Logic`.
10. The user tries deleting the parent with `parent delete n/Bob pnP/91234567` again, PowerConnect carries out `step 5 & 6` similarly just that it is now for parent instead of student.
11. If the parent exists, PowerConnect will then check that the parent to be deleted has no students attached before deleting the parent.
12. Afterwards, PowerConnect will carry out `step 9` for `parent delete`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Design considerations

#### Aspect 1: Where to delete the students from

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete student from their class's student list.
    * Pros: Provides flexibility in adding new features. e.g. deleting all students in a class
    * Cons: Harder to implement

* **Alternative 2:** Delete student from a student list containing all students in PowerConnect.
    * Pros: Uses less memory
    * Cons: Time performance will be worse when there are a lot of students

#### Aspect 2: Whether parent can be deleted if there is a student attached

Current implementation allows a parent to have any number of students attached.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Parent cannot be deleted if there is a student attached to ensure that every student always have one parent.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, since we do not have to update multiple students when a parent is deleted
    * Pros: Easier to add features that involve both a student and a parent

* **Alternative 2:** Parent can be deleted if there is a student attached.
    * Pros: Deletion of parent will be more flexible
    * Cons: Can be time-consuming to update if there are a lot of students attached to one parent

<a name = "attendance-feature"/>

## Attendance feature

### Current Implementation

The attendance feature is facilitated by `Attendance`. It is composed by a `Person` with an `Attendance` object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the attendance mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. <br><br>
Step 2. The user creates a student using the Add command. The `Attendance` of `Students` will be initialized with the initial attendance state (F) indicating that the student is absent.

[//]: # (![Student Add Command]&#40;images/StudentAddCommand.png&#41;)
Step 3. The user wants to mark a particular student as present. The user executes the `Attendance` command with the index of the student and att/T. The `Attendance` of the student will be updated to the current date.

Step 4. The attendance is saved to the storage file automatically after each command. Attendance is saved as the string representation of LocalDate in JsonAdaptedAttendance.

**Full implementation sequence diagram**
![Sequence Diagram](images/AttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Design considerations
We want to make it easy for the user to set current date as present. Thus, we allowed the user to set attendance as T which will automatically register as present today.

#### Aspect: How to store attendance

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store attendance as a JsonAdaptedAttendance object that records the string representation of LocalDate.
    * Pros: Easy to access and manipulate attendance data
    * Pros: Easy to read and write to storage
    * Pros: Flexible to add more features if more features are added e.g. mark as MC, Late..
    * Cons: Hard to implement

* **Alternative 2:** Store attendance as a string representation of LocalDate.
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Pros: Use less memory
    * Cons: Hard to access and manipulate attendance data
    * Cons: Hard to read and write to storage
    * Cons: Hard to add more features if more features are added e.g. mark as MC, Late..

<a name = "grade-feature"/>

## Grade feature

### Current Implementation

The grade feature is facilitated by `grade`. It is composed by a `Student` with an `Assignment` object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the attendance mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. <br><br>
Step 2. The user creates a student using the Add command. The `Test` and `Homework` which extends `Assignment` of `Students` will be initialized with the initial name: Insert student test/homework here!, Score: -100, Weightage: -100, Deadline: No Deadline and Is Done(Homework): false.

[//]: # (![Student Add Command]&#40;images/StudentAddCommand.png&#41;)
Step 3. The user wants to add a test to a student. The user executes the `grade` command with the index of the student and test/TEST_NAME. The `test` of the student will be updated to the name.

![Grade Command](images/Grade.png)

Step 4. The test/homework is saved to the storage file automatically after each command.

**Full implementation sequence diagram**

![Sequence Diagram](images/GradeSequentialDiagram.png)
![Sequence Diagram2](images/GradeSequentialDiagram2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Design considerations
We want to make it easy for the user to set tests without inputting all the details at one go, with the test/homework name being the only field compulsory.

#### Aspect: How to store test

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store test as a JsonAdaptedTest object.
    * Pros: Easy to access and manipulate attendance data
    * Pros: Easy to read and write to storage
    * Pros: Flexible to add more features if more features are added
    * Cons: Hard to implement

* **Alternative 2:** Store attendance as a string representation of Test details.
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Pros: Use less memory
    * Cons: Hard to access and manipulate attendance data
    * Cons: Hard to read and write to storage
    * Cons: Hard to add more features if more features are added

<a name = "parentnok-add-feature"/>

## Parent/NOK Add Feature

### Current Implementation
The add feature for parent/NOK is facilitated by `parent add`.

Given below are example usage scenarios and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.<br><br>
Scenario 1:
1. User launches the application.
2. User wants to add a new `Parent / NOK`.
3. User keys in the parent add command to add a new `Parent / NOK` to PowerConnect.
4. PowerConnect creates a new `Parent / NOK` and automatically saves its data into its storage file (parents.json).

Scenario 2:
1. As user executes the `Student Add` command, PowerConnect cannot locate the `Parent / NOK` to bind to the `Student`.
2. PowerConnect hence **AUTOMATICALLY** creates a new `Parent / NOK`.
3. PowerConnect retrieves the information required for `Parent Add` command from `Student Add` command.
4. PowerConnect automatically saves all changes into its storage files (parents.json & pcclass.json). <br><br>

![Sequential Diagram](images/ParentAddSequentialDiagram.png)

**Reference to get parent particulars sequence diagram**
![Sequence Diagram](images/ParentAddParserUtilSequentialDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Design considerations
We want to make it simple for users to add a new `Parent / NOK` to PowerConnect without having the need to include students attached to him/her. <br><br>
We also want to have a centralized way and adopt defensive coding practices for binding of `Student` and `Parent / NOK`. <br><br>
Furthermore, we do not want to trouble users by forcing them to have **ALL** particulars of a `Parent / NOK`. Hence, we made the command such that it **ONLY** requires minimal information from users: <br>
1. Parent's / NOK's `Name`
2. Parent's / NOK's `Phone number` <br>

#### Aspect: How Parent Add executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users provide **COMPULSORY** details about the parent / NOK only + binding of student and parent / NOK is done at `Student` side **ONLY**.
    * Pro: Defensive coding is applied, reducing chances of bugs
    * Pro: Users are **NOT FORCED** to come up with arbitrary values to fill up **OPTIONAL** details for the parent / NOK to create a new `Parent / NOK`.
    * Con: Hard to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Users provide **ALL** particulars of the `Parent / NOK` + binding of student and parent / NOK is done at `Student` side **ONLY**.
    * Pro: Slightly easier to implement as compared to Alternative 1
    * Pro: Defensive coding is applied, reducing chances of bugs
    * Con: Users are **FORCED** to come up with arbitrary values to fill up any missing values for **OPTIONAL** section.
* **Alternative 3:** Users provide **ALL** particulars of the `Parent / NOK` + binding of student and parent / NOK are done at **BOTH** `Student` and `Parent / NOK`.
    * Pro: Slightly easier to implement as compared to Alternative 2
    * Con: Defensive coding is **NOT** applied, increasing chances of bugs
    * Con: Users are **FORCED** to come up with arbitrary values to fill up any missing values for **OPTIONAL** section.
    * Con: Need to test the feature exhaustively / create sufficient automated tests to ensure `Students` and `Parents / NOKs` are properly bound together.

<a name = "parentnok-edit-feature"/>

## Parent/NOK Edit Feature

### Current Implementation
The edit feature for parent / NOK is facilitated by `parent edit`. <br>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.
<br>
1. User launches the application for the first time. <br>
2. User creates a new `Parent` using ***Parent Add Command*** or gets a new `Parent` created by PowerConnect while executing the ***Student Add Command***. <br>
3. During creation of `Parent`, User encountered one of the two scenarios and requires to edit the `Parent`:
   1. Did not include certain particulars of the `Parent`.
   2. Keyed in wrong particulars for the `Parent`.
4. User wants to edit the `Parent` particulars and hence executes the `parent edit` command with the `Name` and `Phone Number` of the corresponding `Parent` and the `Particulars` to be edited.<br>
   Example of parent edit command: `"parent edit n/Tan Ah Niu pnP/91234567 npnP/65656565"` <br>
5. Edited `Parent` is saved to the storage file automatically after the command. <br><br>

![Sequence Diagram](images/ParentEditSequentialDiagram.png)

**Reference to get parent particulars sequence diagram**
![Sequence Diagram](images/ParentEditParserUtilSequentialDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Design considerations
We want to make it easy for users to edit `Parent / NOK` particulars without manually deleting the `Parent / NOK` and creating a new `Parent / NOK` and reassigning each `Student` attached to original `Parent / NOK` with the new `Parent / NOK`.
<br><br>
We also do not want to trouble user with inputting multiple **PREFIXES** to edit `Parent / NOK`. Hence, users only need to input ***PREFIXES*** belonging to the edited information and the following:
1. Parent's / NOK's `Name`
2. Parent's / NOK's `Phone Number`
3. Particulars that are being amended<br><br>

#### Aspect: How Parent Edit executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Run the command with `parent edit n/<NAME> pnP/<PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER>` + PREFIXES and details of information that are being changed.
    * Pro: Easy to use
    * Pro: Minimal input by user to edit `Parent / NOK` particulars
    * Con: Slightly harder than Alternative 2 to implement
    * Con: Need to test the ***Parent Edit Command*** exhaustively / come up with automated tests to ensure when creating the new `Parent / NOK`, system takes input from original `Parent / NOK` for particulars that are not amended.
* **Alternative 2:** User provides **ALL** particulars of the `Parent / NOK` to be edited even if **SOME** particulars are the **SAME** as original. From these details, system will create a new `Parent / NOK` and replace the original copy of `Parent / NOK` with it.
    * Pro: Easy to implement
    * Pro: Makes use of existing features **Parent Add** and **Parent Delete**
    * Con: Troublesome for the user as there is a need to input **ALL** particulars of a `Parent / NOK` even if he/she is just amending one of the particulars of the `Parent / NOK`.
    * Con: It may cause regressions, user may key in wrong details for some of the `Parent / NOK` particulars as he/she is keying in the command. This will cause much inconvenience for Users especially when the `Parent / NOK` they are amending has **TONS** of information.
    * Con: It is no longer **FAST** and **EASY** for the user to use.

## Binding Student and Parent/NOK Feature

### Current Implementation
The binding feature is created with the consideration of defensive coding in mind. It is executed by PowerConnect when the following commands are executed: `Student Add`, `Student Edit`, `Student Delete`, `Parent Edit` commands.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.
<br>
1. User executes `Student Edit` command and decides to change the parent's/NOK's `Name`.
2. As PowerConnect executes the `Student Edit` command, PowerConnect will also retrieve the corresponding `parent/NOK` and perform similar behaviors to `Parent Edit` command to update the `parent/NOK` info in PowerConnect's database.
3. PowerConnect will also perform similar behaviors of `Student Edit` command to edit the `parent/NOK` information for all `Students` that are bound to the `Parent/NOK`.

### Design considerations
We wanted to adopt defensive coding for this feature to reduce any unwanted bugs. It is also complex when determining which party (students or parents/NOKs) should be the one performing the binding and unbinding and whether to allow both parties to perform.

#### Aspect: How Parent Edit executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform the binding and unbinding **MAINLY** on the `Student` end as the main concern of this binding is to allow users to know the parent/NOK of a particular student.
    * Pro: Logical and solves the issue of pairing `students` and `parents/NOKs`.
    * Pro: Defensive coding used.
    * Pro: Less likely to cause bugs as compared to other Alternatives.
    * Con: Difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Perform the binding and unbinding on the `Parent/NOK` end when commands pertaining to `Parents/NOKs` are executed.
    * Pro: Less information required for `Student Add` command.
    * Con: More information required for `Parent Add` command, resulting in requiring a long input from users.
    * Con: Troublesome for users.
    * Con: More likely to cause bugs as compared to Alternative 1.
    * Con: Difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 3:** Perform the binding and unbinding at **BOTH** `Student` and `Parent/NOK` commands.
    * Pro: Easy to implement.
    * Con: Most likely to cause bugs among the Alternatives.
    * Con: Did not adopt Defensive Coding.
    * Con: Requires exhaustive testing and automated tests to reduce bugs.

## Planned Enhancements

<a name = "enhancement-1-name-fix"/>

#### Enhancement 1: Name Fix
Bug Report: [PE-D][Tester B] Edit Student: name can be numbers, Issue #179.

Feature Flaw: User is able to input numbers into `Student`'s `Name` and `Parent/NOK`'s `Name`.

Fix: Update `Name.java` file's line 19 code such that it will **ONLY** accept alphabets and spacing.
```
From:
public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "[\\p{Alnum}][\\p{Alnum} ]*";

To:
public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "[\\p{Alpha}][\\p{Alpha} ]*";
```
Note: It is perhaps possible for a person to have a name with numbers or symbols in the future. This can be seen in the case where Elon Musk tried naming his child to be [X Æ A-12](https://pagesix.com/article/elon-musk-children/).

<a name = "enhancement-2-age-fix"/>

#### Enhancement 2: Age Fix
Bug Report: [PE-D][Tester B] Edit student: age can be 0 or any extreme value, Issue #178.

Feature Flaw: User is able to input `Age` values like `0` or `999` when logically speaking, there wouldn't be anyone with those `Age` values. Current implementation is self-reliant on users to provide **APPROPRIATE** values.

Fix: Update `Age.java` file such that it **DOES NOT** allow values like `0` and has a **SOFT CAP** of 200 as current longest lifespan of humans is only 122 years. Even after **50 years**, there shouldn't be anyone who **EXCEEDS** this soft cap value.

#### Enhancement 3: Attendance Fix
Bug Report: [PE-D][Tester C] Unclear options for marking students as absent, Issues #174, #166, #162.

Feature Flaw: User is unable to set `Attendance` of a `Student` to be `Absent` once he/she is marked as `Present.

Fix: Update `Attendance` feature such that it allows users to set it to `Absent` and other statuses set by users, such as `Late`, `Left Home Early`, `On medical leave` and reflects the correct displaying message as well in future releases.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

<a name = "product-scope"/>

### Product Scope

**Target user profile**:

* This product mainly targets tuition teachers and in the future, secondary school teachers that prefer CLI to GUI,  manage large groups of students and require ease of access to students' information.

**Value proposition**: <br>
Provides teachers with the ability to manage students administration and academics efficiently by operating on CLI, to complement existing LMS.
* Our product uses CLI instead of GUI.
* Simple application for teachers to keep track of many students in different classes / co-curricular activities (CCAs) that have different phone numbers.
* Our application can be used individually without internet connection (currently supports single user usage ONLY).
* Helps to keep track of students’ parents / next-of-kins’ contact information for emergency purposes.
* Teachers may not be able to match students names and faces well and so this app serves as an easy way to identify students (since there are too many students).
* Streamline administration processes because there’s plenty of students’ information to keep track of (e.g. attendance, assignments, grades, contact details).

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch
   1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
   2. Download the latest `PowerConnect.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/releases).
   3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for PowerConnect.
   4. In the same folder, create a new folder named “image” and store all images to be used for the program in this folder. e.g. student image and parent image. For the student image, it should be named `<STUDENT_NAME><CLASS><INDEX NUMBER>.png`. For the parent image, it should be named `<PARENT_NAME>.png`.
   5. Double-click the jar file.
      <br> **OR** <br>
      Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar PowerConnect.jar` command to run the application.
   6. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data. The window size may not be optimum.<br>

<a name = "saving-data"/>

### Saving data

**1. Dealing with corrupted files** <br><br>
Testers usually get corrupted files when they perform one of the **FOLLOWING** scenarios:
   1. Manually editing the storage files - `parents.json` and `pcclass.json`
   2. Stop the application abruptly without entering the `Exit` command. <br>

**Possible Fix**: <br>
Unfortunately there is no **FIX** for this issue at the moment. Tester will need to manually key in or input the data file again as PowerConnect will erase the data files (`parents.json` & `pcclass.json`) upon **NEXT** valid command execution.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Always duplicate the data files being input into PowerConnect for testing for backup copies in case of file corruption.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **CAUTION:** <br>
Testers should **AVOID** manually amending the storage files **UNLESS** there is an error in the `edit` commands **AND** they are sure of how to amend the storage files!

</div>

<br>

**2. Dealing with missing files** <br><br>
Testers usually get missing files when they perform one of the **FOLLOWING** scenarios:
1. Changing the files / folders names (eg changing `parents.json`, `pcclass.json`, `/images/`, images names)
2. Changing the files / folders location

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Possible Fix:** <br>
Testers can attempt to manually locate the files and folders and ensure they are named correctly as per PowerConnect's requirements.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
Follow PowerConnect Requirements:
1. Images should be stored as `.png` format and inside `images/student` for students or `images/parent` for parents.
2. Storages files should be named as `parents.json` & `pcclass.json`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **CAUTION:** <br>
Testers **SHOULD NOT** change directory name for `images/`, **ANY CHANGE** to image renaming should also be updated via the `edit` commands and storage files (`parents.json & `pcclass.json`) **SHOULD NOT** be renamed.

</div>

### Appendix: Effort
The hardest part of the project was modifying the whole storage class to fit our model correctly. As we created both
students and parents that inherited from persons, the AB3 model storage could not fit our model correctly. As such, we had
to overhaul the whole storage package, and we also supported class functionality for students which made things even harder.<br>

We also made linkages between parents and students to better model the relationship between students and parents. This was
quite time-consuming as we had to make sure each command we implemented adjusted this relationship accordingly.

The UI package also took us quite a while as we were not really familiar with JavaFX, and we had to make sure the information
displays correctly especially with expanding number of information (tests/homework).

The novelty of giving users both the option to specify an image path or use the images folder method to store images for students
or parents also took us some time as we were unsure to hard code the location or not.
