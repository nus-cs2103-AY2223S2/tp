ExpressLibrary is a **desktop app created for librarians to better manage library users and books, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). ExpressLibrary's user commands are simple and intuitive, making it easy for librarians to get their tasks done in a quick and efficient manner.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer. Here is a link to check which version of Java is installed in your computer: [Check Java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html) <br>
If Java is not installed, you may download the corresponding Java version with respect to your operating system here: [Download Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) <br>
_Note that ExpressLibrary is only compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac OS._

1. Download the latest `expresslibrary-{version_num}.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/releases).

1. Create a new folder in a convenient location on your computer.

1. Move the `.jar` file into the new folder.

1. Open the terminal on your computer. If you are not sure how to do this, please refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.

1. Type `cd`, then type in the file path of the new folder you created in step 6 into the terminal window. Press enter. If you are not sure how to use the `cd` command, please refer to [https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-cd](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-cd).

1. In the terminal window, type `java -jar expresslibrary-{version_num}.jar` and press enter. This will start the application and you will be able to use it. Note that double-clicking on the jar file may cause issues with saved data, so it's important to run it using the command above.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addPerson n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addPerson n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Optional items in curly braces requires at least one optional item to be entered.<br>
  e.g `{[n/NAME] [t/TAG]}` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or `n/John Doe` but cannot be empty.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/98102341 p/81234134`, only `p/98102341` will be taken.

* Only **Singapore** phone numbers are valid. (Must be 8 digits long and start with 6, 8 or 9.)

* Emails must abide by **RFC5322 standard**. For more details, refer to section 3.4.1 of the RFC5322 protocol found here
[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.4.1).<br>
  You can also refer to the error message which will appear if you key in an invalid email.

* Redundant parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listPerson`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Saving the data

ExpressLibrary data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ExpressLibrary data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/expresslibrary-{version_num}.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** When editing book fields when it is borrowed, make sure to update **both** the `books` array in the person object and the **main** `books` array separate from `persons` in the json file. Please refer to [_How data is saved_](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-t12-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#how-data-is-saved) for more details.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### How data is saved

:information_source: **_For advanced users only!_**

Data in ExpressLibrary is saved in `[JAR file location]/data/expresslibrary-{version_num}.json`, consisting of an array of `persons` and `books`.

Each person in the `persons` array will contain these fields:

* `name`: Represents the name of the person.
* `phone`: Represents the phone number of the person.
* `email`: Represents the email of the person.
* `books`: Represents the set of books that the person has borrowed, will be an empty set if the person has not borrowed any.
* `tagged`: Represents the tags assigned to the person, will be an empty set if the person has no tags assigned.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

 :warning: **Note:** If editing the file manually, note that `books` in **each person** must be present in the main `books` array. Otherwise, the data file will be invalid.
 </div>

Each book in the `books` array will contain these fields:

* `title`: Represents the title of the book.
* `author`: Represents the author of the book.
* `isbn`: Represents the ISBN of the book.
* `borrowDate`: Represents the date in the form `dd/mm/yyyy` when the book was borrowed by a person, will be an empty string if not borrowed.
* `dueDate`: Represents the date in the form `dd/mm/yyyy` when the book has to be returned by a person, will be an empty string if not borrowed.
* `isBorrowed`: Represents whether the book is borrowed. True if borrowed and false if not.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

 :warning: **Note:** If editing the file manually, note that `borrowDate` and `dueDate` must be included if `isBorrowed` is true and vice versa. Otherwise, the data file will be invalid.

 <br>
 <br>

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If the changes you make to the data file cause its format to become invalid, ExpressLibrary will not be able to use it. In this case, the application will start with an empty data file the next time it is run.

</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I open the terminal on my operating system?<br>

Mac OS: Press `Command + Space` and type `Terminal` in the prompt.<br>
Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ExpressLibrary home folder.

**Q**: Why can't I set due date to be in the past using the `borrow` command? What if the book was not borrowed today?<br>
**A**: Please use the `editBook` command after `borrow` if you would like to edit dates without the current date checks. `borrow` is intended to be used as if the person was borrowing the book on that day.
