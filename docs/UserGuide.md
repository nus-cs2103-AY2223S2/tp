## Quick Reference Guide

This section will walk you through the essential parts of understanding and using QuickContacts in detail.

### User Interface Layout

Upon launching QuickContacts, you will be greeted by the following Graphical User Interface (GUI).

![Annotated UI Layout](images/UiLayoutAnnotated.png)

We can break the GUI into several parts:

1. **Menu Bar**: This is where you find auxiliary features
2. **Result Display Box**: This is where you get feedback from the command executed
3. **Meetings List**: This is where you view all your meetings
4. **Contacts List**: This is where you view all your contacts
5. **Command Box**: This is where you input commands to interact with QuickContacts

### Command Format

QuickContacts provides a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) which rely heavily on commands. In this
subsection, we will discover how the commands are designed.

#### Prefix

Prefixes are placeholders in a command that uniquely identify different input parameters. Each prefix is
_typically_ followed by the corresponding input data.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note**<br>

* There are some input parameters that do not require any corresponding input data.
* There are some input data that share the same prefix. For example: `CONTACT_PHONE_NUMBER` and `MEETING_ATTENDEE`
  share the same prefix `p/`.

</div>

| Prefix   | Corresponding Input Data                     |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `a/`     | `CONTACT_ADDRESS`                            |
| `des/`   | `MEETING_DESCRIPTION`                        |
| `dt/`    | `MEETING_DATE_TIME`                          |
| `e/`     | `CONTACT_EMAIL`                              |
| `end/`   | `MEETING_EXPORT_END_DATE`                    |
| `f/`     | -                                            |
| `l/`     | `MEETING_LOCATION`                           |
| `m/`     | `MEETING_TITLE`                              |
| `n/`     | `CONTACT_NAME`                               |
| `p/`     | `CONTACT_PHONE_NUMBER` or `MEETING_ATTENDEE` |
| `start/` | `MEETING_EXPORT_START_DATE`                  |
| `t/`     | `CONTACT_TAG`                                |

#### Understanding Commands

Now that we are familiar with the prefixes and corresponding input data, let us put them together and see how
a command works. Take the following as an example:

Command: `add n/CONTACT_NAME [p/CONTACT_PHONE_NUMBER] [e/CONTACT_EMAIL] [a/CONTACT_ADDRESS] [t/CONTACT_TAG]...`

| Command Component                                                                                     | Component Type  | Description                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add`                                                                                                 | Command Keyword | Represents the action executed by QuickContacts                 |
| `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/`                                                                          | Prefix          | Uniquely identifies the corresponding input data                |
| `CONTACT_NAME`<br/>`CONTACT_PHONE_NUMBER`<br/>`CONTACT_EMAIL`<br/>`CONTACT_ADDRESS`<br/>`CONTACT_TAG` | Input Data      | Placeholders for the actual data to be supplied for the command |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note**

* `[]` means that the parameter is **optional**.
* `...` means that the parameter can be **supplied multiple times** in the same command input.

</div>

A valid executable command of this example form is:

`add n/Noah t/friend t/nus t/cs2103t`

The above command would create a new contact with the name `Noah` and tags `friend`, `nus` and `cs2103t`.
The phone number, email address and address of `Noah` will be left empty as they are not provided.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip**<br>
Command prefixes can be specified in any order. For example: `add t/friend t/nus n/Noah t/cs2103t` is equivalent to our
example above.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>e.g. if you specify `n/Noah n/Peter`, only `n/Peter` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will
  be ignored.<br>e.g. `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Date and Time Formats

QuickContacts allow for various date and time formats to be inputted for commands that takes them in as arguments, for
example [`addm`](#adding-a-meeting--addm). Below, we can find the valid date and time formats.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip**<br>
Date and time formats can be mixed and matched. For example, `ddMMyyyy HHmm`.

</div>

#### Date Formats

|   | Date Format | Example    | Meaning                         |
|---|-------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | ddMMyyyy    | 01012023   | 1st January 2023                |
| 2 | dd-MM-yyyy  | 01-01-2023 | 1st January 2023                |
| 3 | dd.MM.yyyy  | 01.01.2023 | 1st January 2023                |
| 4 | dd/MM/yyyy  | 01/01/2023 | 1st January 2023                |
| 5 | ddMM        | 0101       | 1st January of the current year |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**

* `dd` refers to the date represented with 2 digits (e.g. `01` for the first day of the month instead of `1`)
* `MM` refers to the month represented with 2 digits (e.g. `08` for August instead of `8`)
* `yyyy` refers to the year represented with 4 digits (e.g. `2023` instead of `23`)

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip**<br>
`ddMM` is a quick way to specify a date of the current year without needing the year. For example, specifying `0101`
in year 2023 is the same as `01012023`.

</div>

#### Time Formats

|   | Time Format | Example |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | HHmm        | 0100    |
| 2 | HH:mm       | 01:00   |
| 3 | HH.mm       | 01.00   |
| 4 | hmma        | 100AM   |
| 5 | h:mma       | 1:00AM  |
| 5 | h.mma       | 1.00AM  |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**

* `HH` refers to the hour in 24-hour time format represented with 2 digits (e.g. `00` for 12 midnight instead of `1`)
* `h` refers to the hour in 12-hour time format represented with 1 or 2 digits (e.g. `1` for 1 o'clock, `12` for 12
  o'clock)
* `mm` refers to the minute represented with 2 digits (e.g. `01` for the first minute instead of `1`)
* `a` represents `AM` or `PM` for 12-hour time format

</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

Here, you may find all the details about every feature that QuickContacts provide to empower you to
make full use of the power of QuickContacts.

### Autocomplete inputs

Simply hit the `TAB` key on your keyboard when you are entering a certain command to have QuickContacts autocomplete the
next nearest command word similar to the one you are typing!

Examples:

* `a` -> `add` after hitting `TAB` (since `add` is the next most similar command word)
* `ex` -> `export` after hitting `TAB`

Autocompletion also works for the next possible prefix for a given command! This way, you will never have to memorise
any prefix nor syntax for commands.

Examples:

* `add` -> `add n/` after hitting `TAB` (since `n/` is the next prefix for `add`)
* `add n/Bobby` -> `add n/Bobby p/` after hitting `TAB` (since `p/` is the next prefix for `add` after `n/`)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* Autocomplete only works for command words and prefixes that expect a corresponding input data. You may refer to the
[Prefix](#prefix) section for more details on prefixes.
* If input matches a command, Autocomplete will autocomplete the [prefixes](#prefix) for the command. If the command does not require any prefix, autocomplete will not do anything.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip**<br>
Prefix autocomplete behaviour defers from commands to enhance user experience. For example:<br>
* `edit 1 n/` -> `edit 1 p/` after hitting `TAB` (if you did not input anything for the prefix `n/`, it would be probable
that you do not want to edit that field)

</div>

### Traversing commands

Have you ever wanted to input commands similar to one that you have just inputted? With command traversal provided in
QuickContacts, you will **never** have to copy and paste commands ever again.

All you have to do is to hit the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys on your keyboard to go to the previous and next command
respectively. It is as simple as that!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Person-Related Commands

In this subsection, you may find all the commands that are related to contacts.

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

- The name of a person is case-sensitive, thus `John Doe` and `john doe` are considered different persons.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
**:warning: Caution**<br>
Tags of more than 10 characters are unsupported! UI artifacts may occur.
