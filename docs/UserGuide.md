## **Introduction**

<img src="images/MyLibLogo.png">

MyLib is a desktop bookmarking application originally built to serve as a single platform for organising and tracking all the online webnovels and comics that you may be reading. However, its general bookmarking features is more than capable of handling any other bookmarking tasks you might have. This not only includes other types of novels, but also blogs, articles, reddit posts, Youtube videos and anything else that you want to track!

With MyLib, you have the ability to throw all your bookmarks onto a **single platform**, and organise them in a **highly personalized** way via a custom set of tags or labels that you can define on your own.

MyLib is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This means that most of MyLib's features are meant to be accessed through typed commands rather than mouse clicks. However, the commands are simple enough such that typing them out will not be much slower than using a GUI, if at all!

## Features
This section provides an in-depth explanation of MyLib's features. For a quick reference of the available commands, use the [Command Summary](#command-summary) table.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/TITLE`, `TITLE` or name of `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/The Odessey`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TITLE [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/The Odessey t/School` or as `n/The Odessey`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/School`, `t/School t/Literature` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/TITLE a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR n/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `a/John Butcher a/Jim Butcher`, only `a/Jim Butcher` will be taken.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `genre`, `tags` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

The format for the command is as follows:
