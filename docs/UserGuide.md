### How your Internship Application Data is Organised in TinS

![data organisation](images/ug/ug-internship-organisation.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Internships

In TinS, an internship application is stored as an **Internship**. An Internship has the following fields:

* `POSITION`: The Name of the Internship Position.
* `COMPANY` : The Name of the Hiring Company.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** Each Internship is **uniquely identifiable** by a **combination** of its `POSITION` and
`COMPANY`. `POSITION` and `COMPANY` fields are **case-insensitive**. <br><br>

Example: An Internship with `POSITION` as `Software Engineer` and `COMPANY` as `Grab` will be identified to be the
same internship as an Internship with `POSITION` as `Software ENGINEER` and `COMPANY` as `GRAB`.
</div>

* `STATUS` : The Status of your Application. This is an **Integer value** from **0 to 3**. Here are the statuses for the
  corresponding integer values:
   * `0` : Interested
   * `1` : Applied
   * `2` : Offered
   * `3` : Rejected

* `DESCRIPTION` : Additional details about the Internship (E.g. Contact Details of Hiring Manager, Link to Internship
  Webpage, Requirements of Internship). This field is optional.

* `TAG` : Customised Tag (E.g. `IMPORTANT`, `PRIORITY`). An Internship can have zero or more tags. All tags in
  TinS are displayed in capitalised letters.
  * `TAG` must be alphanumeric (i.e. a `TAG` should not contain any blank-spaces, hyphens, colons, dashes etc).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

    :bulb: **Tip:** It is recommanded that your entries for `POSITION`, `COMPANY` and `TAG` have a maximum
    of **40 characters**. While TinS will still allow the addition of entries with more than 40 characters, without
    giving a warning, the addition of these fields could affect the visual display of TinS (i.e. truncated fields).
</div>

An Internship can also store **zero or more** **Event**.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Events

In TinS, an **Event** can be used to represent a **Deadline** or an **Interview** associated to an Internship. 

* **Deadline**: An Event that only has an end timing (E.g. Internship Application Submission Deadline,
  Offer Acceptance Deadline)
* **Interview**: An Event that has both a start and end timing (E.g. Interview, Online Assessments)

An Event has the following fields:

* `EVENT_NAME`: The Name of the Event.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

    :bulb: **Tip:** It is recommanded that your entry for `EVENT_NAME` have a maximum of **40 characters**.
    While TinS will still allow the addition of entries with more than 40 characters, without giving a warning, the
    addition of this field could affect the visual display of TinS (i.e. truncated field).
</div>

* `START_DATETIME`: The Starting Time of an Event (in the format: DD/MM/YYYY HHMM).
* `END_DATETIME`: The Ending Time of an Event (in the format: DD/MM/YYYY HHMM).
  * If the Event is a **Deadline**, the `START_DATETIME` will be the same as the `END_DATETIME`.
* `EVENT_DESCRIPTION`: Description of the Event (e.g. Venue, Things to take note of). This field is optional.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Information about Crafting Your Command
This section contains information on how to craft your command.

#### Prefixes and Fields
TinS differentiates between the various fields in your command by its preceding prefix. The Prefixes are designed to be
short, to enable you to quickly indicate which field your information is associated to. Here is the list of fields and
their associated prefixes.

<table>

<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Prefix</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>POSITION</code></td>
<td><code>p/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>COMPANY</code></td>
<td><code>c/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>STATUS</code></td>
<td><code>s/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>DESCRIPTION</code></td>
<td><code>d/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>TAG</code></td>
<td><code>t/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>EVENT_NAME</code></td>
<td><code>na/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>START_DATETIME</code></td>
<td><code>st/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>END_DATETIME</code></td>
<td><code>en/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>EVENT_DESCRIPTION</code></td>
<td><code>de/</code></td>
</tr>

</table>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**  The sequence of a blackspace and a prefix should be reserved solely for indicating information
pertaining to the associated field. <br><br>

Example: If you input a `DESCRIPTION` field as `d/This is a my description p/field`, TinS would recognise the 
sequence <code> p/</code> as an indicator for the `POSITION` field. Hence, the above input would be recognised as an input with
two fields, a `DESCRIPTION` field - `d/This is a description` and a `POSITION` field - `p/field`.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Notes about the Command Format

* Command words are case-insensitive.

  Example: The command `LIST` is the same as the command `list`.

* Prefixes are case-sensitive.

  Example: Entering the prefix `P/` will not be recognised by TinS as `p/`

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the fields to be supplied by you.

  Example: in `add p/POSITION c/COMPANY s/STATUS [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAGS]...`, `POSITION` is a parameter which can be
  used as `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/1 d/Requires python t/IMPORTANT`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.

  Example: `[d/DESCRIPTION]` means in `add p/POSITION c/COMPANY s/STATUS [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...` means the commands
  `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/0` and `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/0 d/This is a description` are both
  valid.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.

  Example: `[t/TAG]...` in `add p/POSITION c/COMPANY s/STATUS [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...` means the command
  `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/0 d/This is a description` and 
  `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/0 d/This is a description t/IMPORTANT t/PRIORITY` are valid.

* Items without `...` after them should only be used **once**.

  <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

  :warning: **Warning:**  If an item without `...` after it is used more than once, TinS will identify the last
  occurrence of that item as the input for that field. <br><br>

  Example: `add p/POSITION c/COMPANY s/STATUS [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...` means that the item, `p/POSITION` should only
  be used once. Hence, if 
  `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/0 d/This is a description t/IMPORTANT p/Data Analyst p/Machine Learning` is
  entered, TinS would identify the input for the field `POSITION` as `Machine Learning`.
  </div>

* Fields can be in any order.

  Example: `add p/POSITION c/COMPANY s/STATUS [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...` is the same as
  `add c/COMPANY s/STATUS [d/DESCRIPTION] p/POSITION [t/TAG]...`

* If the command does not require you to input a field, any extra field/values enter after the identified
  command is ignored.

  The commands in TinS that do not require additional input of fields from user are `list`, `clash`, `home`, `calendar`,
  `stats`, `help` and `exit`.

  Example: If `clash help` is entered, TinS will identify your command as a `clash` command, ignoring all the extra
  fields/values found after `clash`, and execute the command `clash`.

    is uniquely identified by the combination of `POSITION` and `COMPANY` fields, you would not be able to `add` an
    internship application to TinS, if there is a pre-existing internship in TinS with the same `POSITION` and `COMPANY`
    (comparison is case-insensitive). <br><br>
 
    Example: If TinS contains an Internship with `POSITION` as `Software Engineer` and `COMPANY` as `Grab`, the commands
    `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/0` and `add p/SOFTWARE engineer c/Grab s/3` are not allowed.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** In TinS, Tags are standardised to be all in capitalised letters. If you enter
`t/important`, TinS will automatically save it as `t/IMPORTANT` for you.

selected internship, and attach your newly indicated `TAG` fields to your selected internship.<br>
    
Example: If the 1st internship in the list panel has the `TAG` fields, `IMPORTANT` and `PRIORITY`, the command
`edit 1 t/GOOD` will modify the `TAG` field of the internship to contain `GOOD` only.
</div>

**Example**:

After keying in the `edit` command followed by an existing `ID` and the fields `STATUS` and `DESCRIPTION`,
