AutoM8 is a desktop application for auto repair shops that combines the efficiency of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the user-friendliness of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) making it easy for users to manage tasks such as customer records, vehicle information, services, appointments, and inventory tracking. AutoM8 is a powerful tool that helps auto repair shops save time and increase productivity.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add appointment c/CUSTOMER_ID d/DATE t/TIME`, `CUSTOMER_ID, DATE and Time` are parameters which can be used as `add appointment c/2 d/02/02/2023 t/2pm`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes command GUI behaviors:**<br>

* Using entity specific commands (e.g. commandX, where command is a specific operation such as add, edit, etc and X is a specific entity such as customer, vehicle etc) will help you navigate to the respective tabs (e.g. A successful `addvehicle` command will navigate you to the Vehicles tab)
* While clicking on individual items in the items list may cause the UI to show that it is highlighted, the current entity shown in the right panel (Details panel) will not reflect what you have selected*. Please use the respective `view` commands in order to view details of a specific entity.
