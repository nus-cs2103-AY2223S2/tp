SportSync is a **desktop app for managing training sessions and athletes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SportSync can get your training management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## **Quick start**
### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the official Java website [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

1. Download the latest `sportsync.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/releases).

2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SportSync.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

3.Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar sportsync.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   e.g. `cd Desktop\New_Folder` and then `java -jar sportsync.jar`<br>


   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. This shows the **session list**, which is currently empty.<br>
   Below that is the income analytics, which tabulates how much you've earned through your sessions.<br><br>
    
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
   **:information_source: Notes about the window size:**<br>
   * The window size may not be optimum for viewing the sessions and contacts, depending on your screen size. In which case, resize the SportSync window to your liking.<br>
     SportSync will save these preferences and reload them upon startup.
</div>

   <br><br>

   Some example commands you can try:

    : Adds athlete `John Doe` to SportSync.

* `exit` : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

5.Click the `Calendar` tab, or press the shortcut `CTRL + 3`. You have just navigated to the **calendar**, which is currently empty.<br>
   All future scheduled sessions will automatically show up on the calendar.<br><br>

## **Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Parameters are used to specify information that is required for the command to be executed correctly.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you. <br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe…​`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
