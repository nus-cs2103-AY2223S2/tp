## Command Overview

### Command Structure
All commands consists of a command word e.g add. Commands that add or edit fields require fields which start with their corresponding prefixes e.g. r/ for remarks. Indexes are required for some commands to specify the exact opening of interest. e.g. delete 1 deletes the first opening.

### Command Usage
Commands can be entered into the input box at the top of the application as shown below.

![Highlightedinput](images/HighlightedInput.png)

After command is inputted as shown with `upcoming 500`, you can press Enter. Ultron will then execute your command if it is a valid command. If it is an invalid command, Ultron will provide additional details as to what the right command should be.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the fields to be supplied by the user.<br>

  e.g. in `add p/POSITION`, `POSITION` is a field which can be used as `add p/Software Engineer`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `c/COMPANY [d/KEYDATE]` can be used as `c/Google d/Interview@2023-04-01` or as `c/Google`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[d/KEYDATE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `d/Interview@2023-04-01`, `d/Interview@2023-04-01 d/OA@2023-05-02` etc.

- Fields can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `p/POSITION c/COMPANY`, `c/COMPANY p/POSITION` is also acceptable.

- If a field is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the field will be taken, excluding `status` command.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `c/Google c/Shopee`, only `c/Shopee` will be taken.

- Extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

</div>

### 1. Adding an opening : `add`

Having too many internships offers and being unable to keep track of all of them?
Ultron provides you with a platform to remember all your openings so you don't have to!
Just type `add` followed by details of your opening in the format below and you can see
it being added to Ultron.

Format: `add p/POSITION c/COMPANY e/EMAIL s/STATUS [r/REMARK] [d/KEYDATE]…​`

|     Field     |    Format                     |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|   POSITION    |  Alphanumeric characters are allowed. Blanks are not allowed.|
| COMPANY |  Alphanumeric characters are allowed. Blanks are not allowed. |
| EMAIL | Should be of the format local-part@domain   |
|STATUS | Must be of either **found, applied, interviewing, offered, accepted or rejected** and is case-insensitive.|
| REMARK | Should not be blank, if user chooses to add a remark |
| KEYDATE | Must be in the form `KEY@DATE`, where `KEY` is a key event in the application process and `DATE` is the date of the event in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. `KEY` must only contain alphabetic characters, cannot be blank and cannot only contain whitespaces.|

#### Additional notes

- If both `COMPANY` and `POSITION` of a new opening matches a current opening, the new opening will not be added.
- The openings in the list only display `POSITION`, `COMPANY`, `STATUS` and `KEYDATES`.
- To view the full details of the opening, use the `show` command.

Examples:

- `add p/Software Engineer c/Google e/chinese@google.com s/interviewing d/Interview@2023-03-14`

### 3. Editing an opening : `edit`

Accidentally typed the wrong company name? Don't worry, Ultron allows you to edit a previously

  specifying any `KEYDATE` after it.

## FAQ

**Q**: For the `upcoming` command, how is the filtered list sorted?

**A**: Out of the keydates within the time range, the keydate with the earliest date for each opening is chosen. The list is then sorted in ascending order based on each opening's chosen date.

---

**Q**: I have too many keydates for my opening, and it is not displaying properly on the left panel. How do I view them properly?

**A**: You can use the `show` command with the index of the opening of interest, shown [here](#5-showing-full-details-of-opening-show). The full information will then be displayed on the right panel.

---

**Q**: Why can't I see details such as emails or remarks when I add or edit openings?

**A**: These details will only be displayed on the right panel when the `show` command is used, shown [here](#5-showing-full-details-of-opening-show).

---

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**:
Make sure the other system is compatible with Java version `11`. Install ultron.jar into the system from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/releases/download/v1.3/ultron.jar) and navigate to the `data` folder.
Afterwards, copy the `ultron.json` file from the old system and replace it with
the `ultron.json` file in the new system.

---

**Q**: What if I want to delete all openings from a specific company?

**A**: Filter the list by the company of interest using the find command. e.g `find Google`.
Then you can delete each opening one by one based on the filtered list by using the `delete` command.

---

**Q**: I am a macOS user and cannot open my ultron.jar file as it is from an unidentified developer. How do I solve that?

**A**: Your system might have security settings in place to block access to potentially malicious files.
For macOS users, you might want to refer [here](https://www.macworld.com/article/672947/how-to-open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer.html) for troubleshooting.
