## Quick start

### System Requirements

Here is everything you need to install and set up EduMate. For the best possible experience, we recommend that you run the application on the following supported operating systems:

* Windows
* macOS (Both Intel and M1/M2 Chips)
* Linux

Do also ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. If you don’t already have Java `11` or above on your system, head over to [Oracle’s Java download page](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html). 

For users who are using MacBooks with M1 or M2 chips, you might want to head over to [Azul Open JDK download page](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&package=jdk#zulu) to download Java `11`.

To check whether your Java version is compatible with EduMate, please refer to [How To Check Your Java Version](#how-to-check-your-java-version).

### Installation Instructions

**Step 1.** Download the latest `edumate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/releases).

**Step 2.** Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your EduMate.

**Step 3.** Open a command terminal, change directory into the folder where you put the jar file in via the command `cd`, and use the `java -jar edumate.jar` command to run the application.<br>


After a few seconds, a GUI resembling the one shown below will appear. Please take note that the application already includes some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
<center>Diagram 1: The GUI upon start up</center>

<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning!**<br>
EduMate will create a `data` folder which contains the data saved by EduMate. It is essential that you do not modify the contents
of the `data` folder so as not to corrupt your data and result in an empty application by default.

</div>

### Try it out! (Recommended)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Important:** <br>
Ensure you have met the system requirements and installed EduMate properly on a computer. If you have not,
please see [System Requirements](#system-requirements) and [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions)
before continuing.
<br>
</div>

Before we dive into exploring the various features of EduMate, please choose whether you prefer a guided or unguided experience.

1. For a guided experience, please enter `sample 100` in the command box located at the top left of the application. This will generate 100 sample contacts in your EduMate, which you can use to familiarise yourself with the application's functionalities.
2. If you would like to start with a fresh EduMate, simply type `clear` in the same [Command Box](#command-box) located at the bottom of the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Important `clear` or `sample` warnings** <br>

Performing either action will remove any contacts you currently have on your EduMate.

</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
You do not have to enter all your information at once! You can omit some information
and **its corresponding prefix** and enter them in the future!
<br>


Moreover, EduMate will replace the missing fields with placeholders which you
can then edit over later!

</div>

**Step 3.** To add the modules that you are studying as such :
`tag m/[MODULE_CODE] DAY START_TIME END_TIME`
<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
E.g. `tag m/CS2103T MON 8 10 m/CS2101 WED 14 15`

</div>

**Step 4.** To add groups that you currently belong to as such: 
`tag g/[GROUP_NAME]`
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
E.g. `tag g/SoC g/Sailing`

</div>


**Step 5.** You are done! Enjoy! <br>

## Commands

EduMate is a command-driven application, which means that its various functionalities can be accessed by executing specific commands.

### How to interpret the command format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Basic Command Format**<br>

* The first word is the type of command that you are running.<br>
  e.g. for the command `delete 5`, we are running the `delete` command.

* We use [Prefixes](#prefixes) like `p/` and `g/` to label our arguments for the command. Additionally, we use numbers to specify the index of contacts in our list.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 n/Steven Tan` runs the `edit` command with an index of 2 and an `n/` argument of Steven Tan.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are arguments you are meant to fill in.<br>
  e.g. in `view n/NAME`, you can fill in the `NAME` argument like `view n/Amirul Thani`.

* We use `z/` to denote any prefix.<br>
  e.g. `z/FIELD` could mean `n/FIELD` or `s/FIELD`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/Amirul Thani g/Friend` or as `n/Amirul Thani`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MODULE]...​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/`, `m/CS2108 m/CS2101` etc.

* Unless otherwise specified, arguments can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/STATION`, `s/STATION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If an argument is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last** occurrence of the argument will be taken.<br>
  e.g. `p/86544145 p/81353055` will be interpreted as `p/81353055`.

* Unnecessary arguments will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:warning: Invalid Command Formats**<br>

* Indices must be positive numbers.<br>
  e.g. `delete one` is not an accepted command. (Not a number)<br>
  e.g. `delete -1` is also not accepted. (Not positive)


* [Prefixes](#prefixes) must be preceded by a space.<br>
  e.g. `sort m/an/Tan` is not an accepted command for prefixes `m/` and `n/`.


* Commands and prefixes are **CASE-SENSITIVE**.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **General format of commands:** <br>

<img src="images/general_command_format.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">

* **Bolded** portions of the command format implies that inputs are optional.

</div>

## Attributes

Contacts in EduMate have two types of attributes: single-valued and multi-valued.

Single-valued attributes for each contact can only have one value. Examples of single-valued attributes include a contact's name, phone number, email address, Telegram handle, and home station.

Multi-valued attributes, on the other hand, can have multiple values associated with a single contact. Examples of multi-valued attributes include the groups and modules that a contact belongs to.

### Basic Attributes

</div>

### Remove a label from a contact `untag`

With EduMate's `untag` command, you can remove groups or modules from your existing contacts. Additionally, you can unassign lessons from a contact to indicate their availability during that specific period of time. This will help EduMate to suggest more appropriate meet up times when using the meet command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Formats** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>

### Listing all your contacts `list`

With the `list` command, you can get EduMate to display all your contacts in the [Person List](#person-list)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `list`

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tips:** `list` is especially useful when<br>

- You need to view all contacts again after [`find`](#filter-contacts-by-keywords-find) and [`sort`](#arrange-contacts-based-on-criteria-sort).
- Find out the index of the contact you want to view on the [Person List](#person-list).

</div>


## Advanced Commands

Now that you have become familiar with the basics of EduMate, it's time to explore its more advanced features. For a more guided experience, you can run the `sample 100` command to navigate through this section.

### Search Commands

The search commands in EduMate help you to efficiently navigate and manage your contacts. Instead of manually searching through a long list of contacts, these commands allow you to customise how EduMate displays them, making the process much more efficient.

#### Filter contacts by keywords `find`

EduMate's `find` command helps you quickly locate specific contacts by searching for keywords within their fields. This tool allows you to generate a list of contacts that meet certain criteria and manage your contacts more efficiently. 

To use the `find` command, simply type `find` followed by the relevant keywords or criteria. 

The command can also be used with multiple prefixes to refine your search. The results returned will contain at least one keyword from each specified field. Use the `find` command to save time and easily locate the information you need.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `find z/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... z/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

</div>

##### Scenario:

Say you want to filter out contacts who are in the same CCA as you to study for the upcoming finals for CS2100.

Command entered: `find g/CCA m/CS2100`

What you should see:<br>

<img src="images/ug_cmds_pics/FindCommand.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">

<center>Diagram 20: Only contacts tagged with CCA and CS2100 are shown</center>

<br>

##### More Examples of Usage:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Examples**<br>

* `find m/CS2103T CS2109S`: Returns all persons with modules CS2103T or CS2109S
* `find n/Edward Richards`: Returns all persons with names Edward or Richards
* `find p/9093`: Returns all persons with phone numbers that contain 9093
* `find n/Edward m/CS2103T` : Returns all persons with name Edward and module CS2103T
* `find n/Edward Richards m/CS2103T CS2109S` : Returns all persons named Edward or Richards with module CS2103T or CS2109S.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tips on usage**<br>
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. hans will match Hans
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Hans Bo will match Bo Hans
* Only the field specified by the prefix is searched. e.g. n/ means only the name field is searched
* Words matching the first part of the string will be matched e.g. Han will match Hans
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. Hans Bo will return Hans Gruber, Bo Yang

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:warning: Filtered list**<br>

* The `find` command returns a filtered list, so any contacts present in the filtered list will be unaffected by commands that have the capability to modify a contact's information.<br>
  e.g. If the filtered list does not contain any person with contact index 2, any operation relating to contact index 2 will throw an error.
* If you want to run commands related to persons not in the filtered list, just run the `list` command to obtain the full list of your contacts.

</div>


#### Arrange contacts based on criteria `sort`

With EduMate's `sort` command, you have the power to organise your contacts in a way that's most helpful for you. Whether you want to find out who shares the most modules with you or who's likely to become a close friend this semester, the `sort` command can help you out. 

By simply typing `sort` followed by the relevant criteria, you can sort your contacts by name, the number of shared modules, or any other specified field. This feature can help you identify potential study or social groups within your contacts, making it easier to connect and collaborate with others.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Formats** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `sort`: Sorts the contacts by their indices.
* `sort z/a`: Sorts the contacts by their `z` attribute **in ascending order**
* `sort z/d`: Sorts the contacts by their `z` attribute **in descending order**
* `sort z/`: Sorts the contacts by their `z` attribute based on our **default ordering**
* `sort z1/ z2/`: Sorts the contacts by their `z1` attribute, and breaks ties using their `z2` attribute
* `sort [z/]...​`: Sorts the contacts by multiple attributes

</div>



<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Accepted versions for `sort` order**: <br>
In short, in the command formats `z/a` and `z/d`, we only care about the **first letter** immediately after the slash. It can be either in upper case or lower case and can have anything behind it. For example, `z/ascending` and `z/Disco` would both work. However, if the first letter is not either `a`, `d`, `D` or `A`, then we use the **default ordering**.

</div>
<br>

We will now teach you how to effectively use the `sort` command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **How the attributes are sorted**:

* The `NAME`, `EMAIL`, `STATION`, `PHONE` and `TELEGRAM` attributes are sorted by alphabetical order, and is default in **ascending** order.
* For `GROUP`, we sort the contacts based on the number of groups the contact belongs to. By default, we sort in **descending order**.<br>
  e.g. if Alex has 2 groups (TA, NS), and Ben has one group (TA), Alex will be placed before Ben in the default ordering.
* For `MODULE`, we sort the contacts based on the number of **common modules** they share with you. By default, we sort in **descending order**.<br>
  e.g. if Alex has 2 modules (CS1101S, CS1231S), Ben has one module (CS1101S), and you have 2 modules (CS1231S, MA2001), then Alex has 1 module in common with you (CS1231S) and Ben has 0 modules in common with you. As such, Alex will be placed before Ben in the default ordering.

</div>

`sort` is one of the most complicated commands to get your head around. Perhaps a scenario can help you understand better!

##### Scenario (Continuation from previous scenario):

Suppose you want to arrange contacts such from those that take the most number of common modules with you to the least. 

If there is a tie in the number of common modules shared with you, you decide to just rank the name lexicographically.

Command entered: `sort m/d n/a`

What you should see:<br>

<img src="images/ug_cmds_pics/SortCommand.svg" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">

<center>Diagram 21: Contacts ranked according to sorting criteria specified in the Command Box</center>

<br>

##### Extra Explanation:

The command `sort m/d n/a` would mean that EduMate would first sort contacts by decreasing number of common modules with you, and tie-break by its lexicographical ordering.

Hence, Alex Quinn is ranked higher than Amirul as Alex's name is lexicographically smaller than Amirul even though they share the same number of common modules with you.

##### More Examples of Usage:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Examples**<br>
* `sort n/d`: Sorts by name in descending order
* `sort m/a`: Sorts by the number of modules they have in common with you (in ascending order)
* `sort t/`: Sorts by Telegram handle in its default ordering (ascending)

</div>


### Storage Commands

The storage commands allow you to save and load your EduMate data into a file. This means you can easily backup your data and access it from different devices or share it with others.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **You can use these commands if**:
* You want to create backups of your EduMate
* You want to explore the functions of EduMate without fear of losing your data
* You want to maintain multiple versions of EduMate

</div>

#### Save a copy of EduMate `save`

Using the `save` command in EduMate, you can easily save your data into a file with a name of your choice. This allows you to back up your data and access it later or share it with others.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>

</div>

### Meet Commands

#### Suggest places to meet with your contacts `meet`, `study`, `eat`

The `meet` command in EduMate is used to suggest suitable meet-up locations and times for you and your contacts, based on various criteria such as availability and proximity. It is useful for finding a mutually convenient time and place to meet up with friends or study partners. EduMate also offers more specialised commands such as `eat` for suggesting places to eat and `study` for suggesting places to study.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `meet INDEX_1 INDEX_2 ...`
* `study INDEX_1 INDEX_2 ...`
* `eat INDEX_1 INDEX_2 ...`

</div>

##### Scenario (Continuation from previous scenario):

After sorting your contacts, you decided to ask Tae Seong, Alex, Amirul and Kevin from your CCA to study for CS2100. 

Problem is, you do not know when all of them are free! Luckily, you have EduMate to find out for you!

You can execute the `study` variant of the `meet` command
whilst referring to their index on the Person List.

From here, EduMate will recommend the most optimal places and the best possible time to meet and study for the final exam.

Command entered: `study 35 29 10 23`

What you should see:<br>

</div>

### Schedule Commands

The `organise` command in EduMate is used to add meet ups with selected contacts, whether they are customised or recommended by the meet commands. The feature is useful for keeping track of your upcoming meet ups in an organised and efficient way. 

In addition, EduMate offers the `unorganise` command, which helps you manage and clean up scheduled meet ups by removing them - making it easy to stay on top of your schedule.

Any organised meet ups will be displayed at EduMate's [Scheduled Meet Up Panel](#scheduled-meet-up-panel).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

**A**: Yes you may! Refer to [Editing a Contact's Details](#edit-a-contacts-details-edit)

**Q**: How is EduMate better than Microsoft Outlook or uWave?

**A**: We have features that Microsoft Outlook or uWave don't have but we think should be integrated into these platforms, like the [meet up recommenders](#meet-commands)
and several search functions like [sort](#arrange-contacts-based-on-criteria-sort) and [find](#filter-contacts-by-keywords-find). It is also open-source so student developers can 
suggest new features, and it is easily extensible!

**Q**: What is the difference between `tag` and `edit` feature when it comes to tagging groups and modules?

**A**: When you `edit` a profile with the `m/` prefix, the existing modules of the person gets entirely deleted and the new module is added. `tag` however, just adds the module for you without modifying other existing tags. The same explanation could be applied to `untag` as well.
