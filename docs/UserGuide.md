## **Introducing InternBuddy**

InternBuddy is a desktop application for university undergraduates to manage their internship applications.
It is optimized for typing where it allows you to complete internship management tasks much more efficiently via
the keyboard as compared to using traditional [Graphical User Interface](#glossary) (GUI) applications. If you are a fast typist
who is seeking a one-stop platform to systematically organise your internship applications,
then InternBuddy is the perfect buddy to accompany you during your internship hunt.

InternBuddy runs using Java 11 and is available on the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

## **Command Information**

[//]: # (@@author potty10)
### Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the fields that are to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `add n/COMPANY_NAME`, you may input the command as `add n/Apple` where you supply the
  value `Apple` to the field `COMPANY_NAME`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `edit INDEX [n/COMPANY_NAME] [c/COMMENT]`, you may input the command as `edit 2 n/Apple` where
  you omit the value for the field `COMMENT`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as `   ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Java`, `t/Java t/Python` etc.

* Fields can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `n/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE`, both `n/Apple r/Software Engineer` and `r/Software Engineer n/Apple`
  are acceptable.

* If a field is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the field will be taken.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `r/ROLE`, typing in `r/Front-end Developer r/Back-end Developer` will cause your
  input to be interpreted as `r/Back-end Developer`.

* Extraneous values for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list`, and `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. If the command format is `help`, typing in `help 123` will cause your input to be interpreted as `help`.

* Command names are case-sensitive. For example, `help` will work, but `HELP` or `Help` will not.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Prefixes and Constraints for Fields
In InternBuddy's commands, we refer to a range of fields that you can replace with values to input information that
is customised to your internship applications.

There are 3 important things that you should note:
1. Most fields have associated [**prefixes**](#glossary). 
    * Prefixes are short character combinations that you can use to identify the field to which a value belongs.
      They are a convenient shorthand that allows you to refer a field without having to type out its
      entire name, saving precious time.
    * For example, in `add n/Apple`, the value `Apple` is associated with the
      field `COMPANY_NAME` since the `n/` prefix is used.
    * Prefixes are **case-sensitive**. `n/` will work but `N/` will not.

2. When entering a command, do remember to use **spaces** to separate different fields of information. If you enter multiple fields without using space(s) to separate them, InternBuddy will interpret them as a single field.
    * For example, `edit 1 n/Visa r/Software Engineer` associates `Visa` with the field `COMPANY_NAME` and `Software Engineer` with the field `ROLE`.
    * Conversely, `edit 1 n/Visar/Software Engineer` associates `Visar/Software Engineer` with the field `COMPANY_NAME`.

3. There are **constraints** that you must adhere to when replacing fields with values. 
   * Constraints differ based on the fields.
   * If you do not adhere to these constraints and enter invalid values, an error message will be
     displayed in the [Result Display](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface) when you
     press <button>Enter</button>. The message will alert you to the invalid input and provide information
     on how to correct the command.

Table 2 provides a summary of the fields with their descriptions, prefixes and constraints.

| Field          | Description                                                                                                        | Prefix | Constraints                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `INDEX`        | The index number of the internship entry as displayed in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface) | -      | A positive integer that is smaller than or equal to the largest index number shown in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface). Note that 0 is not a positive integer. |

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 2: Fields with their descriptions, prefixes and constraints</p>

### Details on `STATUS` and `DATE`
The field `STATUS` represents the current status of an internship application. It can only take on one
of the following values: `New`, `Applied`, `Assessment`, `Interview`, `Offered`, `Accepted` and `Rejected`.
Note that this is **not case-sensitive**. Table 3 explains the meaning of each status.


| `STATUS`     | Description                                                                                                                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `New`        | You have recently saw this internship opportunity and would like to record it in InternBuddy. Also, you have yet to apply for it. |
| `Applied`    | You have applied for this internship opportunity and you are currently waiting for the company's response.                        |
| `Assessment` | You are currently in the technical assessment stage of the application process.                                                   |
| `Interview`  | You are currently in the behavioral interview stage of the application process.                                                   |
| `Offered`    | You have been offered the internship opportunity.                                                                                 |
| `Accepted`   | You have accepted the internship opportunity.                                                                                     |
| `Rejected`   | You have either been rejected by the company, or that you have rejected the internship offer.                                     |

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 3: Description of statuses</p>

Depending on the status of the internship application, the `DATE` field will be interpreted differently. Table 4
documents the meaning of `DATE` with respect to each `STATUS` value.

| `STATUS`     | Interpretation of `DATE`     |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| `New`        | Deadline of Application      |
| `Applied`    | Date Applied                 |
| `Assessment` | Date of Technical Assessment |
| `Interview`  | Date of Behavioral Interview |
| `Offered`    | Deadline of Offer Acceptance |
| `Accepted`   | Date of Acceptance           |
| `Rejected`   | Date of Rejection            |

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 4: Description of dates</p>

### Duplicate Internships
InternBuddy does not allow for the storage of duplicate internships. Should you enter a command that attempts to store 
a duplicate internship, InternBuddy will remind you that the internship already exists.

2 internships are considered to be duplicates if they have matching `COMPANY_NAME`, `STATUS`, `ROLE` **and**
`DATE`. The comparison is **case-insensitive**.

In Table 5, internships A and B are considered as duplicate internships, because they have the same
`COMPANY_NAME`, `ROLE`, `STATUS` and `DATE`. Note how the capitalisation differences in `COMPANY_NAME`
and `ROLE` do not affect the comparison.


| `Field`        | Internship A      | Internship B      |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `COMPANY_NAME` | Google            | google            |
| `ROLE`         | Frontend Engineer | frontend engineer |
| `STATUS`       | New               | New               |
| `DATE`         | 2023-02-02        | 2023-02-02        |
| `COMMENT`      | NA                | NA                |
| `TAGS`         | C++               | Java              |

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 5: Duplicate internships</p>


Meanwhile, in Table 6, internships C and D are not considered as duplicate
internships, because they have different values for `COMPANY_NAME`.


| `Field`        | Internship C      | Internship D      |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `COMPANY_NAME` | Apple             | Apple Inc         |
| `ROLE`         | Frontend Engineer | frontend engineer |
| `STATUS`       | New               | New               |
| `DATE`         | 2023-02-02        | 2023-02-02        |
| `COMMENT`      | NA                | NA                |
| `TAGS`         | Java              | Java              |

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 6: Non-duplicate internships</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

[//]: # (@@author potty10)
### Duplicate Tags
If you attempt to store duplicate tags within the same internship entry, InternBuddy would only store one of them. A duplicate tag refers to a tag that is identical to another tag in every way, including the spelling and capitalisation (tags are **case-sensitive**). In other words, a duplicate tag is a tag that is an exact copy of another tag.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Features**
InternBuddy offers a variety of features that can empower you to systematically track your internships.

[//]: # (@@author eugenetangkj)
### Listing all Internships : `list`
Shows the list of all internship entries that you have stored in InternBuddy.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** `list` will always reset the
[View Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface) to display the welcome message.
</div>


Format: `list`

[//]: # (@@author eugenetangkj)
### Adding an Internship : `add`

Do you have a new internship to track? Add it to InternBuddy using the `add` command.

Format: `add n/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE s/STATUS d/DATE [c/COMMENT] [t/TAG]...`

* The optional `COMMENT` field has a default value of `NA`. This means that if you do not specify any value for it,
  the comment for the newly added internship will be `NA`.
* The optional `TAG` field will be empty by default. This means that if you do not specify any value for it, there
  will be no tags associated with the newly added internship.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** You will not be able to add [duplicate internships](#duplicate-internships) into InternBuddy (an error message will be shown). If you attempt to add [duplicate tags](#duplicate-tags) into the same internship entry, InternBuddy will only store one of the tags.

</div>

Examples:
* `add n/Food Panda r/Web Developer s/New d/2023-02-01 c/I love Food Panda! t/React t/Front-end` Adds a new internship entry
  with company name `Food Panda`, role `Web Developer`, status `New`, deadline of application `2023-02-01`,
  comment `I love Food Panda!` and tags `React` and `Front-End`. This example is illustrated in Figure 3.
* `add n/Deliveroo r/Software Engineer s/Assessment d/2023-02-01` Adds a new internship entry with
  company name `Deliveroo`, role `Software Engineer`, status `Assessment` and date of technical assessment
  `2023-02-01`.
* `add n/Food Panda s/New d/2023-02-01` Displays an error because the `ROLE` field is missing.
* `add n/Apple r/App Developer s/New d/2023-02-01 t/Java t/Java` Adds a new internship entry 
  with company name `Apple`, role `App Developer`, status `New`, deadline of application `2023-02-01`,
  and tag `Java` (only one tag is stored since the two tags provided are duplicates).

### Editing an Internship : `edit`

Made a mistake, or wish to update your internship entry? The `edit` command allows you to make modifications.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/COMPANY_NAME] [r/ROLE] [s/STATUS] [d/DATE] [c/COMMENT] [t/TAG]...`

* Edits the internship whose index number is `INDEX`.
* You have to provide at least one of the optional fields.
* You can reset the comment of an internship to the default value of `NA` by typing `c/` without specifying any comments
  after it.
* You can remove all of an internship’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any other tags after it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**  When editing tags, the existing tags of the internship will be removed. For example, if the
internship with index 1 currently has the tags `iOS` and `Swift`, editing the internship via `edit 1 t/macOS` will lead
to the internship only having the tag `macOS`. To have all 3 tags, you need to type `edit 1 t/iOS t/Swift t/macOS`.

</div>

Examples:

Suppose you have at least 2 internships displayed in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).

* `edit 2 s/Assessment r/Software Developer` Sets the status and role of the second internship entry as `Assessment` and
  `Software Developer` respectively. This example is illustrated in Figure 4.
* `edit 2` Displays an error because the command does not satisfy the criteria of having at least one optional field.
* `edit 2 t/Java t/Go` Sets the tags of the second internship entry as Java and Go (existing tags will be removed).
* `edit 2 c/` Sets the comment of the second internship entry to be `NA`.
* `edit 2 t/` Removes all the tags of the second internship entry.

### Viewing an Internship : `view`
Want to view the details of a specific internship entry? You can do so using the `view` command.

Format: `view INDEX`
* Views the details of the internship entry with index number `INDEX` as indicated in
  the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* The details will be shown in the [View Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* Apart from the internship details, a custom tips box is also included in the
  [View Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface). The tips provide you with suggestions on how to improve your internship experience,
  where their content change according to the status of the internship entry.

Examples:
* `view 3` Assuming that you have at least 3 internships displayed in the
[List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface), this displays the details of the third internship in the
[View Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* `view -1` Displays an error because `INDEX` must be a positive integer.
* `view 8` Assuming that you have 7 internships displayed in the
  [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface), this displays an error because `INDEX` cannot be greater
  than the maximum index shown in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface), which is 7 in this case.

### Copying an Internship to Clipboard : `copy`
Need to quickly export the details of an internship? Use `copy` to copy the details of an internship to
your clipboard.

Format: `copy INDEX`

* Copies the details of the internship entry with index number `INDEX` as indicated in
  the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* The copied text will be in the format of
  `Company Name: COMPANY_NAME; Role: ROLE; Status: STATUS; Date: DATE; Comment: [COMMENT]; Tags: [TAG]`.

Examples:
* Suppose the first internship displayed in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface)
  has company name `Amazon`, role `Cloud Architect`, status `New`, date `2023-03-28`, comment `I love Amazon!`,
  and tags `AWS` and `Cloud Services`. Then, `copy 1` copies `Company Name: Amazon; Role: Cloud Architect; Status: New; Date: 2023-03-28; Comment: [I love Amazon!]; Tags: [Cloud Services][AWS]` to your clipboard.

* `copy -1` Displays an error because `INDEX` must be a positive integer.
* `copy 8` Assuming that you have 7 internships displayed in the
  [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface), this displays an error because `INDEX` cannot be greater
  than the maximum index shown in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface), which is 7 in this case.

### Finding Internships : `find`
Want to locate selected internship entries? Use the `find` command to filter through
your entries and narrow down your search.


Format: `find [n/COMPANY_NAME]... [r/ROLE]... [s/STATUS]... [d/DATE]... [t/TAG]...`

* You have to provide at least one of the optional fields.
* The `find` command is **case-insensitive**, and it returns **exact matches only**. For example,
  `find n/Google Ltd` will not return an entry with company name `Google` because `Google`
  does not exactly match with `Google Ltd`. On the other hand, `find t/Java` will return
  an entry with tag `java` because the search is case-insensitive.

There are 2 possible ways for you to use the `find` command.

**Method 1: Use a single field type**

e.g. `find s/Applied`, `find s/Applied s/New`, `find n/Google n/Apple n/Meta`

* The `find` command returns all internship entries that match with **any** of the values that you provide.

More examples:
* `find s/Applied s/New` returns all internship entries that have a status of **either**
  `Applied` **or** `New`.



**Method 2: Use 2 or more different field types**

e.g. `find n/Google n/Apple s/New`, `find n/Google n/Apple s/Applied s/New`, `find n/Google r/Engineer t/Python t/Java`

* The `find` command returns all internship entries that match with **at least one** value for
  **every** field type that is specified.

Detailed example:
* Figure 5 below shows InternBuddy starting with 5 internship entries. After entering `find n/Google n/Apple t/python t/java`,
  the internships in green boxes were returned while those in red boxes were not.

  
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ug-find-example.png" width="500" />
</p>

   <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 5: Example of the find command in action</p>

<br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* Table 7 explains the reasoning behind Figure 5.
  

| Index of Internship | Returned? | Explanation                                                                       |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                   | Yes       | It contains at least one company name `Google` and both tags `python` and `java`. |
| 2                   | Yes       | It contains at least one company name `Google` and at least one tag `python`.     |
| 3                   | Yes       | It contains at least one company name `Apple` and at least one tag `java`.        |
| 4                   | No        | It lacks both of the searched tags, `python` and `java`.                          |
| 5                   | No        | It lacks both of the searched company names, `Google` and `Apple`.                |

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 7: Explanation of Figure 5 </p>





More examples:
* `find n/Google n/Apple s/Interview` returns internship entries that have a status `Interview` **and** have
  a company name of `Google` **or** `Apple`.
* `find n/Google n/Apple s/Applied s/Interview` returns internship entries that have company names
  of `Google` **or** `Apple` **and** roles of `Applied` **or** `Interview`.

  

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** The `find` command always searches through all of your internship entries
that are stored in InternBuddy. This means that it will also search through entries that are not currently displayed
in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).

### Getting Upcoming Events and Deadlines : `upcoming`
Want to view your upcoming events and deadlines? You can do so using the `upcoming` command.

Format: `upcoming`
* The `upcoming` command provides the list of internships that have events (interviews/assessments) or deadlines (application deadline/offer acceptance deadline) within the upcoming week.
* In other words, it gives you the list of internships that have a `STATUS` of `New/Offered/Assessment/Interview` and a `DATE` that  falls within the upcoming week.
* Upcoming week is defined as the current day and the 6 days that follow it.



Examples: 
* `upcoming` If today's date is 5 January 2023, it will list all internships that have a `STATUS` of `New/Offered/Assessment/Interview` and a `DATE` that is from 5 January 2023 to 11 January 2023 inclusive.


[//]: # (@@author potty10)
### Deleting Internships by Indices : `delete-index`
Need to keep your screen neat and tidy? `delete-index` can help you achieve this by deleting multiple internships using their indices.

Format: `delete-index INDEX [INDEX]...`

* Deletes the internship whose index number is `INDEX`.
* If multiple `INDEX` are provided, multiple internships can be deleted.
* At least 1 `INDEX` must be provided.
* `INDEX` does not need to be unique. If 2 or more of `INDEX` have the same value, only the first one will be taken.


Examples:
* If you run `delete-index 1` after `find`, it will delete the first entry as displayed by `find` in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* If you run `delete-index 1` after `list`, it will delete the first entry as displayed by `list` in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* `delete-index 1 3` Deletes the first and third
  internships in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* `delete-index 3 1 3 3 1` Deletes the first and third
  internships in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
* `delete-index` Displays an error because at least one `INDEX` must be specified.

[//]: # (@@author potty10)
### Deleting Internships by Fields : `delete-field`
Wish that you can delete internships using fields instead of indices? You can
certainly do so using `delete-field`.

Format: `delete-field [n/COMPANY_NAME]... [r/ROLE]... [s/STATUS]... [d/DATE]... [t/TAG]...`

* You have to provide at least one of the optional fields.
* The `delete-field` command is **case-insensitive**. For example, `delete-field n/Google` deletes all internships with company names `google`, `Google` or `gOOgle`.
  Also, `delete-field t/java` deletes all internships with tags `Java`, `java` or `JaVa`.
* `delete-field` deletes entries with **exact matches only**. For example, `delete-field n/Google Ltd` will not delete an entry with company name `Google` because
  `Google` does not exactly match with `Google Ltd`.

There are 2 possible ways for you to use the `delete-field` command.

**Method 1: Use a single field type**

e.g. `delete-field s/Applied`, `delete-field s/Applied s/New`,
`delete-field n/Google n/Apple n/Meta`

* The `delete-field` command deletes all internship entries that match with **any** of the values that you provide.

More Examples:
* `delete-field s/Applied s/New` deletes all internship entries that have a status of **either**
  `Applied` **or** `New`.


**Method 2: Use 2 or more different field types**

e.g. `delete-field n/Google n/Apple s/New`, `delete-field n/Google n/Apple s/Applied s/New`,
`delete-field n/Google r/Engineer t/Python t/Java`

* The `delete-field` command deletes all internship entries that matches with **at least one** value for
  **every** field type that is specified.

More Examples:
* `delete-field n/Google n/Apple s/Interview` Deletes internship entries that have a status `Interview` **and** have
  a company name of `Google` **or** `Apple`.
* `delete-field n/Google n/Apple s/New s/Interview` Deletes internship entries that have company names
  of `Google` **or** `Apple` **and** roles of `New` **or** `Interview`.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** The `delete-field` command only searches through the internship entries
that are displayed in the [List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface). This means that it
will never delete entries that are not currently displayed in the
[List Panel](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface).
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**  If you use an unknown prefix or a prefix not specific to this command, it will be interpreted as
part of your input value. For example, `delete-field r/Engineer c/Good company` will try to delete internships with a role
of `Engineer c/Good company`.
</div>

### Clearing all Internships : `clear`
The `clear` command permanently deletes all entries from InternBuddy.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**  It will be good to think twice before running this command because
once you run this command, all your internship data will be deleted. In the event that you
accidentally ran `clear`, you can refer to [Appendix C](#appendix-c-populating-internbuddy-with-sample-data)
to repopulate InternBuddy with sample data.

### Navigating through Past Commands

Want to reuse a command you entered just now but too lazy to type it all out again? InternBuddy has got your back!
After clicking on the [Command Box](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface), pressing <button>&uarr;</button> and <button>&darr;</button> will fill the [Command Box](#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface) with commands that you have recently entered.
This allows you to effortlessly access and use past commands without having to go through the tedious process of typing them all over again.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** InternBuddy only tracks your past commands from the current run of
InternBuddy. This means that if you restart InternBuddy, you can no longer navigate to the commands that
you entered during the previous run.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** Once you have navigated to the first command that you have ever entered into
InternBuddy, pressing <button>&uarr;</button> will not lead to any further change. Similarly, once you have
navigated to the current state of waiting for new input, pressing <button>&darr;</button> will not
change anything.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tip:**  InternBuddy keeps track of all past commands entered, regardless of whether they were
valid or not. Hence, if you accidentally entered an invalid command, you can easily navigate to it and
make amendments accordingly without having to type out the entire command again.
</div>

Example:
- Figure 7 illustrates how you can navigate through past commands where the inputs
  `list`, `clear` and `upcoming` are entered in this particular order. The <button>&uarr;</button> and
  <button>&darr;</button> keys are used to navigate between the different inputs.

### Saving your Internship Data

Your internship data for InternBuddy are saved automatically after any command that changes the data. The data are saved
in a file `internbuddy.json` which is located in a subfolder `data` in the [home folder](#quick-start)
where you placed `internbuddy.json`. There is no need to save manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** The file location of `internbuddy.json` is stated in the
<a href="#exploring-the-graphical-user-interface">Status Bar</a> of the GUI.
</div>


### Loading the Data

InternBuddy data is loaded from `internbuddy.json` automatically at the beginning of each run. There is no need to load
manually.
* If `internbuddy.json` is missing, InternBuddy will start with a new data file containing the sample internship
  entries.
* If the content in `internbuddy.json` was altered and as a result has an invalid format, InternBuddy will start with an
   empty data file.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**  Starting with an empty data file means that all internship entries previously stored in
InternBuddy will no longer be present. This is equivalent to a data wipeout. Therefore, we advise against tampering
with the content in `internbuddy.json` unless you are confident in doing so. If you are interested, you can refer to
      [Appendix B](#appendix-b-customising-the-data-file) for instructions on how to do so.

</div>


## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install InternBuddy in the other computer and overwrite the file `internbuddy.json` that it creates with the
file `internbuddy.json` that is stored on your existing computer.

**Q**: Does InternBuddy support undoing of commands? For example, can I undo a `delete-index` action?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, the current version of InternBuddy does not support the `undo` command. However, it is a feature
that we are exploring and hope to implement in the future!

## **Appendix B: Customising the Data File**
If you are an advanced user of InternBuddy, you can directly edit the contents of your data through the `internbuddy.json`
file without using the GUI. The `internbuddy.json` file is found in the `data` subfolder of your InternBuddy
[home folder](#quick-start).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">
:warning: **Warning:**  If you are new to InternBuddy or are not confident in reading JSON files, we will advise you against
directly editing the `internbuddy.json` file. This is because if you accidentally make a mistake that leads to the JSON
file not having the correct format, InternBuddy would restart with the sample data file, wiping out any data that you had
previously.

</div>

The following steps outline how you can properly edit the `internbuddy.json` file:
1. Open the `internbuddy.json` file by double-clicking on it. If you are prompted to select an application to open
   the file, you can choose any text editor such as `Notepad`.
2. Once opened, you will see the JSON data file in a format as shown in Figure 8. Referring to Figure 8,
   each box contains the data for one specific internship entry.
3. Within each box, you can see that there are pairings where each pair is made up of a `FIELD` and `VALUE`.
   <p align="center">
    <img src="images/ug-appendix-b-json-example.png" width="550" />
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 8: Sample JSON data file</p>

   <br/>

4. To manually change the value of a field, simply replace the text for `VALUE`. Figure 9 illustrates an example
   where we change the value of `STATUS` from `assessment` to `interview` for the internship entry with company name
   `Google`. Once your changes have been made, you can save the file by pressing <button>CTRL</button> + <button>S</button>.
   <br/><br/>
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">
    :warning: **Warning:**  Make sure that you follow the <a href="#prefixes-and-constraints-for-fields">constraints</a>
    when substituting in your own values. If the constraints are not satisfied, InternBuddy will not be able to
    read your data in the `internbuddy.json` file and will restart with all your internship data cleared.

    </div>

    confirm whether you want to overwrite it when attempting to populate InternBuddy with sample data.
    It is important to only choose to overwrite the existing file if you are absolutely certain that you
    do not need your old InternBuddy data anymore. If you are unsure, you can always make a backup copy
    of the file before overwriting.
