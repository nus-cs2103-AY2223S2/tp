<h3>Update a patient by name</h3>

* A patient reports a change of address, phone number, or any other information? You can easily update the information of that patient with the `p update` command.
  \
  &nbsp;
* **Format:** `p update PATIENT_NAME [-n NEW_NAME] [-ph NEW_PHONE_NUMBER] [-em NEW_EMAIL] [-ad NEW_ADDRESS] [-dob NEW_DATE_OF_BIRTH] [-g GENDER] [-ic IC] [-da PATIENT_DRUG_ALLERGY] [-ec NEW_EMERGENCY_CONTACT_NUMBER]`
    * When you wish to update some, if not all information of a patient, simply include the parameters that you wish to update.
      \
      &nbsp;
* **Example:**
    * Suppose we wish to update the phone number, email address, emergency contact number of John to be 91234567, johndoe@example.com and 98765432 respectively. The command would be:`p update John Doe -ph 91234567 -em johndoe@example.com -ec 98765432`

    * Suppose we wish to update the name and drug allergy of Bety to be Betsy Crowers and Aspirin respectively. The command would be:`p update Bety -n Betsy Crower -da Aspirin`
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">:information_source: **Note:**

    <li>You can update 1 to 9 items, 9 being all pieces of information of a patient.</li>
    <li> When updating, it is necessary that you use the full name of the patient. Since we do not allow duplicated names, indicating full name would be sufficient to eliminate any ambiguity duing update.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Retrieve a patient record by name</h3>
* Need to promptly search for a specific patient record? You can quickly retrieve the information of a patient by searching with his or her name.

  &nbsp;
* **Format:** `p find ...PATIENT_NAME`
    * The search is case-insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
      \
