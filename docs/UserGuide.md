## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.

2. Download the latest `TrAcker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TrAcker.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TrAcker.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

## About TrAcker

TrAcker is a **desktop app for CS2040 Teaching Assistants (TAs) to centralise the CS2040 tasks involving them.
It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, TrAcker will aid the task management for CS2040 TAs. Commands are similar to vim / terminal commands rather than intuitive commands since
CS2040 TAs are familiar with it.

Let's clear a little confusion that might arise:
- Why are students not allowed to be added together with the creation of an event?
  - This is because the app is meant for an attendance taking for a CS2040 TA who plans ahead. So, if a student can be added with an event,
   it defeats the purpose of it being an attendance taking application.
- Why are overlapping event date and time not allowed to be added?
  - It is because TrAcker also functions as a schedule application for the CS2040 TA. So, if overlapping events
    can be added, the TA will be unsure if they are actually free during that period.
- Tutorial duration is fixed at 1 hour.
- Lab duration is fixed at 2 hours.
- Consultation duration is fixed at 1 hour.
- <b> Invalid date error will be shown if the start date is before 1900 or after 2099. </b>

## User Guide Notations

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.
  * e.g. in `rm INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `rm 1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  * e.g. `touch Tutorial/NAME [-date dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm]` can be used as `touch Tutorial/firstTutorial` or as `touch Tutorial/firstTutorial -date 10/10/2025 10:00`.
* Parameters, excluding index parameters, can be in any order.
  * e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME telegram/TELEGRAM_HANDLE`, `telegram/TELEGRAM_HANDLE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  * e.g. while `addStudent STUEDNT_INDEX Tutorial/TUTORIAL_INDEX` is acceptable, `addStudent Tutorial/TUTORIAL_INDEX STUEDNT_INDEX` is not acceptable.
  * If a parameter is expected only once in a command, but you specified it multiple times, TrAcker takes only the last occurrence of the parameter only, <b> other than `rm` and `delete` commands </b>.
    * e.g. if you specify `telegram/IAmGeorge telegram/IAmNotGeorge`, only `telegram/IAmNotGeorge` will be taken.
    * e.g. if you specify `addStudent 1 Tutorial/1 Tutorial/2`, TrAcker add the student whose index is 1 to Tutorial whose index is 2.
    * e.g. if you specify `rm 1 rm 2`, TrAcker will throw an error.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `:wq`, and `clear`) are ignored by the parser.
  * e.g. if you specify `help 123`, the parser interprets it as `help`.
  * e.g. if you specify `:wq help`, the parser interprets it as `:wq`.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not expect such parameters may be parsed incorrectly, especially for date field.
  * e.g. if you specify `touch Tutorial/firstTutorial -date 10/10/2025 10:00 2025`, the parser interprets it as adding a tutorial with date 10/10/2025 10:00 2025, which is not a valid date. Hence, TrAcker throws an error.
* Visual images for successful commands have been shown for each feature. Not all commands have visual images to avoid clutter, and the visual images might not be the exact same as what you have as commands have been executed beforehand for some visuals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

<div id='sort-students'></div>

## Sort / Filter features

### Sort students in recurring events: `sort-student`

- Sorts the students in events available in the order specified by the TA. The sorting method can either be alphabetical, participation level or urgency level. With each sorting method, the TA can also choose top down or bottom up order as well. If the TA wishes to sort all students under his supervision (regardless of type), he can specify type to be “all”.
- The urgency level of a student is given by 100 - participation. The lower the performance level, the higher the urgency level.
- The master list in the student tab will only be sorted if the group selected is all.
- If the group selected is not all (i.e consultation, lab, or tutorial), the list of students in the event card in the event tab will be sorted, and not the master student list.
- The sorted list should be a secondary list and does not replace the existing, non-sorted one. Additional features to replace the existing one may be added in the future if deemed useful.
- Sorting an empty group will not throw an error, because technically, the empty group remains sorted.

Format: `sort-student GROUP METRIC SORTING_ORDER`
For the GROUP, it can be only lab, tutorial, consultation, or all.
For the METRIC, it can be only name, address, email, performance or remark.

Examples:

* `sort-student lab name reverse`
* `sort-student tutorial performance nonreverse`
* `sort-student consultation email nonreverse`
* `sort-student all remark nonreverse`


`sort-student all name reverse` visual:
![Ui](images/SortSuccess.png)

`sort-student consulation name reverse` visual:
![Ui](images/SortConsultationSuccess.png)

<div id='filter-students'></div>

### Filter students in recurring events: `filter`

Filters all students depending on the metric specified by the TA. The metric can either be by a cut-off participation level (out of 100%) or minimum urgency level (out of 100).
The urgency level of a student is given by 100 - performance. The lower the performance level, the higher his/her urgency level.
The filtered list should be a secondary list and does not replace the existing, non-sorted one. Additional features to replace the existing one may be added in the future if deemed useful.

Format: `filter METRIC THRESHOLD`
For the METRIC, it can be only performance or urgency.
The THRESHOLD value must be an integer between 0 to 100 (inclusive).

Examples:

* `filter performance 60 `
* `filter performance 50`
* `filter urgency 20`
* `filter urgency 90`

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Help Features

<div id='help-section'></div>

### Help for the application: `help`

Returns a list of instructions on what are the commands and also what input format is required to successfully execute certain functions.

This should help new TAs understand the syntax better and also reduces the need to memorise the syntax or refer to any external documentations.

Format: `help [TYPE] [EVENT_TYPE]`

Examples:
* `help`
* `help student`
* `help event`
* `help event lab`
* `help event tutorial`
* `help event consultation`
* `help organisation`

`help` visual:
![Ui](images/HelpSuccess.png)

Should you want to take a look at the User Guide in the repository, you can click on the "help" menu.
Then, you can click on "copy url" and paste it in your browser.

help url visual:
