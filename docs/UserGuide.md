## PowerConnect User Guide

Greetings! Welcome to PowerConnect! <br>

Are you looking for a simple and all in one solution for your teaching needs? Look no further. <br>


PowerConnect is a fully customized offline application for tuition and school teachers to manage students' and parents' administrative details. We are still working to scale our features, so we mainly target tuition teachers currently. However, school teachers, do still give us a try. While our
features are limited at this stage, we are working hard to scale them and be a useful tool in conjunction with [Learning Management System (LMS)](#glossary) tools currently in the market. <br>

We aim to make PowerConnect as simple as possible for you to use with a focus on command line interface where you don't
have to navigate complex user menus to access the features you need, especially if you can type fast. <br>

Without further ado, let's get started!

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `PowerConnect.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for PowerConnect.

4. In the same folder, create a new folder named “images” and another folder named "student" and "parent" in the "images folder". e.g. student image and parent image. For the student image, it should be named `<STUDENT_NAME><CLASS><INDEX NUMBER>.png`. For the parent image, it should be named `<PARENT_NAME>.png`. More details [here.](#images)

5. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar PowerConnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list student` : Lists all students.

    * `student 1A add n/Tan Ah Cow in/13 s/M pn/Tan Ah Niu pnP/91234567 rls/Father` : Adds a student in class 1A named `Tan Ah Cow` to PowerConnect.

    * `student 1A delete in/13` : Deletes the student with index number 13 in class 1A.

    * `student 1A grade in/13 test/CA1 score/75 deadline/15/05/2023 weightage/20`: Adds a test named CA1, score of 75, deadline of 15/05/2023, weightage 20% to student index number 13 in class 1A.
    * `student 1A gradedelete in/13 test/CA1`: Deletes a test named CA1 for student in class 1A with index 13.
    * `exit` : Exits the app.


7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.
8. To clear the student and parent list, make use of student [delete](#deletestudent) and parent [delete](#deleteparent) commands.

While PowerConnect do not currently support the `clear` function in this version, you may clear all saved `Students'` and `Parents'/NOKs'` information in the following 2 ways:
1. Locate the folder `data`, double click into it and ***REMOVE*** these two files `parents.json` and `pcclass.json`.
2. Locate the folder `data`, double click into it, ***OPEN*** both files `parents.json` and `pcclass.json` and ***MANUALLY*** clear all data inside and save both files as ***EMPTY*** files.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** <br>
If you happen to mess up the file data while ***EDITING*** the files mentioned above (**NOT RECOMMENDED** to edit this way **EVEN IF** you are an **EXPERIENCED USER**), you should always follow the steps above to perform a **FULL CLEAR** of data using the steps above to avoid any unwanted errors! <br><br>
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** <br>

## Images (Recommended method to store student and parent/NOK images)

1. In the same folder as your PowerConnect.jar file, create a new file called `images` if it does not exist. <br>

2. Place all your student images in this format: `images/student/<STUDENT_NAME><STUDENT_CLASS><STUDENT_INDEX_NUMBER>.png` <br>

    Place all your parent images in this format: `images/parent/<PARENT_NAME>.png` <br><br>

    Location of where images folder should be at. (Same directory of PowerConnect.jar)
![image message](images/images1.png)

3. Inside the images' folder, create a folder called `student` and `parent` if it does not exist.

**Q**: Where is the information stored?<br>
**A**: Data is stored locally in the ./data folder. The student and class information is stored in the file pcclass.json whereas the parents information is stored in parents.json.

**Q**: What is CLI?<br>
**A**: Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text based user interface used to run the
program. Essentially you do not need a mouse to run this program at all!

**Q**: Do I need to pay for this product?<br>
**A**: No! We made a commitment to keep this program free for all teachers. Feel free to run and use our program, but remember to like, share and comment down below any feedback.

**Q**: Why is my command not working?<br>
**A**: PowerConnect is particular with the prefixes (/) and they need to be in the exact format as specified in the user guide. Don’t worry, with practice, it would be second nature to you.

**Q**: There are some terms that I do not understand in the User Guide...<br>
**A**: You may refer to our [Glossary section](#glossary) to better understand the terminologies used in this User Guide!
