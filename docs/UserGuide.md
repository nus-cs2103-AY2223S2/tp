## Introduction

**Vimification** is a **desktop app** built for Vim enthusiasts to manage tasks and deadlines, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

Since **Vimification** is modeled after **Vim**, the command syntax for the Vimification CLI closely mimics Vim.

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Purpose of this User Guide

This user guide aims to help you make the most of Vimification's powerful and intuitive interface by providing a comprehensive overview of its vim-like features and functionality.

Whether you're new to the app or an experienced Vim user, the guide will walk you through everything you need to know to efficiently manage your tasks and deadlines. You'll learn how to create and organize tasks, set due dates, prioritize your work, and track your progress. The guide also includes troubleshooting tips and solutions to common issues, ensuring that you can use Vimification with confidence and ease.

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

### Navigating Vimification

Similar to Vim, you can use the `j` and `k` (or `↓` and `↑`) keys to navigate down and up the task-list, respectively.

Assuming you already have tasks loaded in Vimification (we will show you how to add tasks later), pressing `j` will move you down the list.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/2.before-j.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/3.after-j.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Similarly, pressing `k` brings you up the task list.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/4.before-k.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/5.after-k.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In Vim, pressing `l` moves the cursor to the right. In Vimification, however, pressing `l` will move the focus to the right-side panel and display the details of the currently selected task.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/6.before-l.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/7.after-l.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In Vim, pressing `h` moves the cursor to the left. In Vimification, however, pressing `h` will move the cursor back to the task list, and hence clearing the details displayed in the right-side panel.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/10.before-h.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/11.after-h.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**NOTE: If you find yourself unable to navigate the task list, try pressing `j` or `k` multiple times to refocus Vimification onto the task list. Alternatively, you can click on the task list with your mouse to recalibrate the focus.**

**NOTE: Using arrow keys is not recommended since they are not supported.**

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

### Exiting Vimification

Similar to Vim, you can exit Vimification by typing `:quit` or `:q!` on your keyboard while using Vimification.

<img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/8.quit.png">
<br><br>
<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

### Trying out the commands

Similar to Vim, you can enter command mode in Vimification by **pressing the `:` key** on your keyboard. This will move the focus to the command input field located at the bottom of the application.

<img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/9.showcommand.png" alt="Example of Show Command Image" title="How to bring up the command input">

Type the command in the command box and press the `Enter` key to execute it. For example, typing **`:help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.

Some example commands you can try:

- `:a "tutorial"` : Adds a task with the title `tutorial` to Vimification.

- `:a "quiz for cs2103T" -d 2023-04-01` : Adds a task with the title `quiz for cs2103T` and deadline `2023-04-01` to Vimification.

- `:d 2` : Deletes the 2nd task shown in the current list.

- `:quit` : Exits Vimification.

- `:help` : Brings up the manual page.

2. Refer to the [Features and commands](#features-and-commands) below for details of each command.

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Using the commands

Similar to Vim, you can enter command mode in Vimification by **pressing the `:` key** on your keyboard. This will move the focus to the command input field located at the bottom of the application.

<img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/9.showcommand.png" alt="Example of Show Command Image" title="How to bring up the command input">

**NOTE: Besides the navigation commands (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`), every command always starts with a colon (`:`).**

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## General information on a task's attributes

In Vimification, a task can has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Meaning & Purpose                                    | Flag | Accepted Values                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title     | Name or brief description of a task.                 | `-t` | One single word or a phrase enclosed in quotation marks (`""` or `''`)\*.    |
| Deadline  | The date (and time) the task is due at.              | `-d` | In the format of `yyyy-MM-dd`, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, `EEE` or `EEE HH:mm`^.    |
| Labels    | The labels that the task has.                        | `-l` | One single word, or any phrase enclosed in quotation marks (`""` or `''`)\*. |
| Status    | Status of a task, indicating that is it done or not. | `-s` | 0, 1, or 2. See below for more details.                                      |
| Priority  | How important/urgent a task is.                      | `-p` | 0, 1, 2 or 3. See below for more details.                                    |

^`EEE` format accepts the first 3 letters of a day of week (`Mon`, `Tue`, etc.), case insensitive.

\*For a title or label, if the phrase is one single word, the quotation marks are optional. Another 2 constraints on the quotation marks are:

- There can be at most 2 nested quotation marks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (so `"Say 'SUPER "Cheesy"' "` and `'Say "SUPER 'Cheesy'" '` are not allowed).
- 2 nested quotation marks cannot be the same types &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (so `"Say "cheese" "` and `'Say 'cheese' '` are not allowed).

| Priority | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 0        | Unknown priority |
| 1        | Very urgent      |
| 2        | Urgent           |
| 3        | Not urgent       |

| Status | Meaning     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 0      | Not done    |
| 1      | In progress |
| 2      | Completed   |

<p style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Information on commands' parameters

_Take note of how the command format is being interpreted to know what parameters it requires._

Flags like `-d`, `-l` and `-p` act as identifier for the parameter that comes immediately after the flag.

- e.g. `:a "<title>" [-d <deadline>]`, the `-d` indicates the deadline attribute of a task.

Words in **angle brackets** are **compulsory** parameters to be supplied by the user.

- e.g. in `:a <title>`, the user must provide the `<title>` parameter, for example, `:a "Do weekly quiz"`.

Words in **square brackets** are **optional** parameters to be supplied by the user.

- e.g. `:a "<title>" [-d <deadline>]`, the user can provide flag `-d` with the `<deadline>` parameter (but this is not compulsory).

Bracketed items with `…`​ behind means that user can provide multiple parameters.

- e.g. `:a <title> [-l <label>]…​`, for example, `:a "Do OP2 slides" -l cs2101` and `:a "Do OP2 slides" -l cs2101 -l presentation` are both acceptable.

Parameters identified by flags can be in any order.

- e.g. `:a "Do OP2 slides" -l cs2101 -p 1`, `:a "Do OP2 slides" -p 1 -l cs2101` are both acceptable.

Some flags can be used with alternative forms.

- e.g. `-d` flag (to identify the deadline attribute of a task) can also be used with `--deadline`.

Redundant parameter(s) at the end will raise an error, and the command will not be executed.

- e.g. if the user inputs `:help 123`, the command `help` will not be executed, and they will receive an error message.

6. `:f -o -l "label1" -l "label2"` filter for tasks contain "label1" or "label2"

Note:

- If both flag `-a` and flag `-o` are not provided, you can only use a single argument.
- You cannot use flag `-a` and flag `-o` at the same time.
- If flag `-a` is provided, the conditions are combined with **and** operator. If there is no other flag, all tasks will be selected.
- If flag `-o` is provided, the conditions are combined with **or** operator. If there is no other flag, no task will be selected.

### Sorting task

Sort by the parameters as specified by the flag.

Format: `:s [-d] [-s] [-p]`

| Flag | Alternative form |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| `-d` | `--deadline`     |
| `-s` | `--status`       |
| `-p` | `--priority`     |

Example of command:

1. `:s -s` sort for tasks by status
2. `:s -d` sort for tasks by deadline
3. `:s -p` sort for tasks by priority level

Note:

- Only one flag should be present.

### Refreshing task list

Refresh the task list and revert it back to the original state by removing all filter or sort.

Format: `:refresh`

### Undoing the previous command

Format: `:undo`

You can undo the previous command executing the `:undo` command.

### Using macro

Sometimes we might have to add the exact same task every week, say `:a "Do CS2103 weekly quiz".` Typing repeated and identical commands could be time-consuming, and Vimification is aware of it. This is where the **macro feature** comes in.

A macro is a customizable template-like command that streamlines the process of running repeated commands. For example, you can define a macro `cs2103t` that maps to `a "Do CS2103 weekly quiz" -d Fri 14:00`. Afterward, whenever you type `:cs2103t`, your input will be transformed into `:a "Do CS2103 weekly quiz" -d Fri 14:00`.

### Defining new macro

Format: `:macro -a <macro> <command_string>`

| Parameter          | Meaning                                        | Example          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `<macro>`          | The macro to be defined, can only be one word  | `l2103`          |
| `<command_string>` | The command string to be mapped with the macro | `"f -l cs2103t"` |

Note:

- If the macro is already defined, this command will replace the old mapping with the new one.

### Deleting a macro

Format: `macro -d <macro>`

| Parameter | Meaning                                       | Example |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `<macro>` | The macro to be deleted, can only be one word | `l2103` |

### View all macros defined in the application

You can view all macros and their mappings by keying in `:macro -l`.

### Exiting the application

Similar to Vim, we can use the `:quit` or `:q!` to exit the application.

### Saving the task list data

The task list data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing existing task list data

Existing task list data is saved at a JSON file `[JAR file location]/.vimification/tasklist.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

### Editing existing macro data

Existing macro data is saved at a JSON file `[JAR file location]/.vimification/macromap.json`. Users can edit this file directly to manage the macros that can be used in the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Vimification will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.

</div>
