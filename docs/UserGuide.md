## 1.2. Key Terms

<a markdown="span" href="#1-introduction"> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Back to 1. Introduction** </a> <br>

**Deck**<br>

A deck refers to a collection of flashcards that are organized together based on a specific topic or subject.
For example, you might create a deck of flashcards to study for a math test, with each card containing a different math problem and solution.

**Card**<br>

A card refers to a flashcard within a deck. A card contains a question or prompt, and the corresponding answer or solution.
During a review session, the card will only show the question, encouraging you to actively recall the answer.
Once you attempt the question, you can command the card to reveal the answer and test your knowledge.

**Tag**<br>

A tag refers to the level of difficulty (easy/medium/hard) you can assign to each card. It helps you prioritize your study time and focus on the flashcards that are more challenging or require more review.
A card can only have at most one tag at any time.

## 3.1. Command Components

<a markdown="span" href="#3-features"> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Back to 3. Features** </a> <br>

This section explains some common components you may find in a command.

| Component                 | Example              | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter**             | `QUESTION`, `ANSWER` | Parameters are placeholders where you have to insert your input.<br/> <br/>Suppose `add q\QUESTION a\ANSWER` is a valid command to add a card. You can simply replace `QUESTION` and `ANSWER` with the question and answer of your choice.                                                                               |  
| **Prefix**                | `q\ `, `a\ `, `t\ `  | Prefixes are used to identify the parameters of a command. <br><br> For example, prefix `q\ ` identifies the parameter `QUESTION` in the command `add q\QUESTION`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Optional Component**    | `[t\TAG]`            | Optional components can be **omitted** in certain commands.<br/> <br/>For example, `add q\QUESTION a\QUESTION [t\TAG]` is a valid command to add a card.<br><br>The first two components `q\QUESTION`, `a\ANSWER` are compulsory. The last component `t\TAG` is optional.                                                |
| **Multi-value Parameter** | `KEYWORDS...`        | These are parameters that can appear **multiple times**. <br><br> For example, the command `findCards KEYWORD...` filters all the cards based on the keywords specified.<br><br>This means that the parameter `KEYWORD` can:<br>- Appear one time: `findCards cell`<br>- Appear multiple times: `findCards cell biology` | 
| **Index**                 | `INDEX`              | Index refers to the index of the card/deck you want to target from the list. The index must be a positive number (1, 2, 3...). <br/> <br/>For example, `deleteDeck 1` deletes the first deck in the deck list.                                                                                                           |
| **Flag**                  | `-e`, `-m`, `-h`     | Flags are used to toggle a particular setting or behavior.<br/><br/> For example, `review 1 -e` lets you review questions in the first deck that are tagged as **easy** only.                                                                                                                                            |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be considered.
  e.g. if you specify `q\What is photosynthesis q\What is a cell`, only `q\What is a cell` will be considered.
- Extraneous parameters succeeding commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. e.g. if the command specified is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3.3. Main Mode - Before Selecting a Deck

<a markdown="span" href="#3-features"> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Back to 3. Features** </a> <br>

### 3.3.1. Adding a Deck : `addDeck`

Before you can add any cards, you must first create a deck. It's super easy though, just use the simple command below to get started with your first deck!

Format: `addDeck DECK_NAME`
- `DECK_NAME` is the name of the deck you want to create. 
  - Deck name is case-sensitive and cannot be duplicated, e.g., if you already have a deck named `Science`, you cannot create another deck named `Science`. However, you can create a deck named `SCIENCE` since `SCIENCE` may be an acronym.
  - You do not need any prefix before deck name.

Example:
- `addDeck Science` will create a deck titled Science.
- `addDeck Math` will create a deck titled Math.

### 3.3.2. Editing a Deck : `editDeck`

You just created a deck, but you realised you made a typo! Fret not, you can easily edit the name of the deck with this command.  

Don't worry! Editing a deck name will not affect the cards stored inside it.

Format: `editDeck INDEX DECK_NAME`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck you want to edit.
- The deck's index can be found in the displayed deck list.
- `DECK_NAME` is the new name you want to assign to the specified deck.
- The new deck name must not match any existing deck names (Deck names are case-sensitive).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:** Make sure that the index you are providing is valid! For example, `editDeck -1` will result in an error message on the result display as -1 is an invalid index.

</div>

Example: 
- `editDeck 1 Chemistry` will edit the name of the first deck in the deck list to "Chemistry". 
- `editDeck 2 Math` will edit the name of the second deck in the deck list to "Math". 

### 3.3.3. Deleting a Deck : `deleteDeck`

Once you have no use for a deck, you can delete the deck and all the cards within it with this command.  

Format: `deleteDeck INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck in the deck list.
- The deck's index can be found in the displayed deck list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:** <br>
- Be careful, a deck (and cards within the deck) once deleted cannot be retrieved!
- Make sure that the index you are providing is valid! For example, `deleteDeck -1` will result in an error message on the result display as -1 is an invalid index.

</div>

Example: 
- `deleteDeck 1` deletes the deck at index 1 and all the cards in that deck. 

### 3.3.4. Finding Decks by Keywords: `findDecks`

If you're looking for a way to quickly find a specific deck among the many you've created, you can use a handy command to filter your decks based on their names. Give it a try!

Format: `findDecks KEYWORD...`
- You can include multiple KEYWORDS - as long as a deck's name contains at least one keyword, the deck will be found.
- At least one KEYWORD must be given.
- This command does not support partial words, e.g., `findDecks program` will not return the same list of decks as `findDecks programming`, despite `program` being a partial word of `programming`.
- Keywords are **case-insensitive**. `findDecks programming` and `findDecks PROGRAMMING` will return the same filtered decks.
- Deck names matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).

Example:
- `findDecks science programming` filters decks whose names match keywords `science` **or** `programming`. Below is the application display right after this command is executed.

![FindCardsCommandDisplay](images/FindDecksCommandDisplay.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

üí° **Tip:** 
- Notice there is a small text box `Finding Decks with keyword(s): science programming` below the filtered list of decks. This text box is displayed as long as the decks are filtered. It is to help you remember what you have previously searched for!
- Notice that the result display will also show how many decks have been listed.

</div>

### 3.3.5. Showing all Decks : `showDecks`

After you filtered the decks using `findDecks`, you can see all the existing decks again using this command.

Format: `showDecks`

### 3.3.6. Selecting a Deck : `selectDeck`

Once a deck has been created, you can access the list of cards inside it with this command. 
Refer to the [Main Mode - After Selecting a Deck](#34-main-mode---after-selecting-a-deck) section to find out what commands you can run with a deck selected!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

üí° **Tip:** <br>

- A deck can be selected and accessed anytime as long as you are in the Main Mode.
- This means you can switch to different deck while already selecting another deck!

</div>

Format: `selectDeck INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck in the deck list.

Examples:
* `selectDeck 2` will select the deck at index 2. 
  * The cards in this deck (if exist) will be displayed on the right panel. 

### 3.3.7. Clearing the data : `clear`

Perhaps you want to start over and create new sets of decks and cards. 
This command clears all the existing decks and their associated cards from the application database. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:** This command is irreversible! You cannot retrieve your data after executing this command.

</div>

Format: `clear`
- Upon executing the command, a pop-up alert will appear and request you to confirm your decision.
  <br>
  ![clear confirm](./images/ClearConfirm.png)

- Selecting `Yes` will clear all data.  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3.4. Main Mode - After Selecting a Deck

<a markdown="span" href="#3-features"> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Back to 3. Features** </a> <br>

With a deck selected, you can see all the cards in the deck on the right panel! 
Now you can interact with the cards in the selected deck.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
Note that you will not be able to make any deck-related changes (e.g. `addDeck`, `deleteDeck`) until you unselect the current deck.
</div>

### 3.4.1. Adding a Card: `addCard`

This command allows you to add a card to the **selected** deck. 

Remember, every card needs to have a question and an answer, and it can have a **maximum of one** difficulty tag.

Format: `addCard q\QUESTION a\ANSWER [t\TAG]`
- `QUESTION` field of the card is **case-sensitive** and cannot be duplicated in the same deck.
  - For example, if you already have a card with question `What is a loop` in the deck, you cannot create another card in the same deck with question `What is a loop`. 
  - However, you can create another card with question `What is a LOOP` since `LOOP` may be an acronym.
- The same `QUESTION` may exist in multiple decks, i.e., a card can belong to multiple decks.  

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

üí° **Tip:** <br>

- A tag can only be of value Easy, Medium, or Hard.
- Tags are **case-insensitive** (`easy` and `EASY` are treated the same).

</div>

Examples:
* `addCard q\What is chemical symbol for Oxygen? a\O` adds an untagged card with the given question and answer to the deck.
* `addCard q\What is gravity? a\A force of attraction between objects due to their mass t\Easy` adds a card tagged as "easy" with the given question and answer to the deck.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### 3.4.2. Deleting a Card : `deleteCard`

You can swiftly delete an existing card from the current selected deck with this command.

Format: `deleteCard INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the card in the card list on the right panel.
- The card's index can be found in the displayed card list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
- Note that this is irreversible!
- Make sure that the index you are providing is valid! For example, `deleteCard -1` will result in an error message on the result display as -1 is an invalid index.
</div>

* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`. The card's index can be found in the displayed card list.

Example:
- `deleteCard 2` will delete the 2nd card in the deck.

### 3.4.3. Editing a Card : `editCard`

If you made mistakes while creating a card, no problem! You can easily edit any existing card using this command.

Format: `editCard INDEX [q\QUESTION] [a\ANSWER] [t\TAG]`

- Edits the card at the specified `INDEX`. The card's index can be found in the displayed card list.
- At least **one** of the optional components must be provided.
- Existing values of the card will be replaced by the input values.
- If the same prefix appears multiple times, only the **last** occurrence of the prefix will be considered. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:** Make sure that the index you are providing is valid! For example, `deleteCard -1` will result in an error message on the result display as -1 is an invalid index.
</div>


Examples:
* `editCard 1 q\What is chemical symbol for Carbon? a\C` edits the question and answer of the 1st card to be `What is chemical symbol for Carbon?` and `C` respectively.
* `edit 2 q\What is a recursion?` will only edit the question of the 2nd card to `What is a recursion?`. The other fields of the card (answer, tag) remain unchanged.
* `edit 3 q\What is a recursion? q\What is a loop?` edits the question of the 3rd card to be `What is a loop?`. 

### 3.4.4. Finding Cards by Keywords in Question : `findCards`

This command allows you to find specific cards you want to interact with based on the keyword(s) you enter.

It shows all the cards in the selected deck whose **questions** contain **any** of the given keyword(s).

You may interact with the filtered cards using their new indices, through commands such as `editCard` and `deleteCard`.

Format: `findCards KEYWORD...`
- You can include multiple KEYWORDS - as long as a card's question contains at least one keyword, the card will be found.
- At least one KEYWORD must be given.
- Keywords are case-insensitive. `findCards what` and `findCards WHAT` will return the same filtered cards.
- Question field of cards matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
- This command does not support partial words, e.g., `findCards partia` and `findCards partial` will **not** return the same result despite "partia" being a partial word of "partial".

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Since the command does not support partial words, take extra caution when searching for words ending with punctuation! For example `findCards loop` will **not** return a Card with question `What is a loop?`. For this example, you should search `findCards loop?` instead.  
</div>

Example:
- `findCards recursion loop` shows all the cards whose questions match the keywords `recursion` **or** `loop`.

![FindCardsCommandDisplay](images/FindCardsCommandDisplay.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

üí° **Tip:** 
- There is a small text box `Finding Cards with keyword(s): recusion loop` below the filtered list of cards. It remains on display as long as the cards are filtered. This is to help you remember what keywords you are searching for!  
- The result display will show how many cards matching the keywords have been found.
</div>

### 3.4.5. Showing all Cards : `showCards`

After you filtered the cards using `findCards`, you can see all the cards in the selected deck again using this command.

Format: `showCards`

### 3.4.6. Unselecting a Deck : `unselectDeck`

If you want to make deck-related changes, you must first unselect the current deck you are in.
Refer to the [Main Mode - Before Selecting a Deck](#33-main-mode---before-selecting-a-deck) section to find out what commands you can run without a deck selected!

This command allows you to unselect the currently selected deck.

Format: `unselectDeck`
- Upon unselecting a deck, you can no longer see the cards inside that deck.

## 3.5. Before entering Review Mode

<a markdown="span" href="#3-features"> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Back to 3. Features** </a> <br>

### 3.5.1. Setting the Limit of Cards per Review: `setLimit`

If you've got a long deck of cards but only want to test yourself on a certain number of them during a review session, no problem! You can use a handy function to set an upper limit on the number of cards you'll be reviewing. 
While the limit is in effect, the deck will be truncated to the specified number of cards. Give it a try!

You can set the limit back to 'none' to view all cards in the deck for future reviews.

Format: `setLimit LIMIT_NUM` or `setLimit none`

- `LIMIT_NUM` must be a whole number between 1 and 2147483647 inclusive. 
- If `LIMIT_NUM` is greater than the number of cards inside the deck to be reviewed, you will review **all** the cards in that deck.

Examples:
* `setLimit 30`
* `setLimit none`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3.6. Review Mode

<a markdown="span" href="#3-features"> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Back to 3. Features** </a> <br>

Once ready, you can enter the Review Mode to test yourself on the cards of a deck. You can also specify the difficulties of the cards of the deck you want to test, e.g., you just want test medium and hard cards only.

![ReviewModeComponent](images/ReviewModeComponent.png)

In the review mode, you will see:
- On the left panel - the updated statistics of the current review (current deck, current card number, number of cards tagged each difficulty) and a navigation guide of the keys.
- On the right panel - the card that is currently under review, which you can flip to reveal the answer and then tag with a given difficulty.

To review a card, you can attempt the question on the card (in your mind or on a paper if you prefer!) before flipping it. 

Flipping a card reveals the answer - based on how close your guess was to the answer or how confident you were when attempting, you can then tag the card with a difficulty of easy, medium or hard.

Your goal would be to eventually have all cards in a deck be tagged as easy!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### 3.6.1. Starting a Review: `review`
From the Main Mode, run this command to enter the Review Mode!

Format: `review INDEX [-e] [-m] [-h]`

  - `-m` include this flag to test cards tagged as "medium"
  - `-h` include this flag to test cards tagged as "hard"
  - Omit any flags to test all cards in the deck

Examples:
* `review 5 -e -h` lets you review all the cards tagged as "easy" or "hard" in the 5th deck.

### 3.6.3. Review Command Keys

![Review Command Keys](images/ReviewCommandKeys.png)

The diagram above shows the commands you will use to interact with the cards during a Review. 
You must press the `Enter` key after typing in the command to execute it, e.g., pressing the key `p` alone will not flip the card.

Notice that the keys are all close to the `Enter` key so that you can breeze through decks of cards ergonomically!
- The top row of keys are commands to flip cards or move to the previous/next cards. 
- The bottom row of keys are commands to tag the difficulty of the current card.

# 4. FAQ

<a markdown="span" href="#1-introduction"> üè† **Back to top** </a> <br>

**Q**: Will my data be automatically saved?<br>
**A**: **Yes**, PowerCards automatically saves your data after every command entered.

**Q**: Where is my data saved?<br>
**A**: If you have run PowerCards at least once, there will be a folder named `data` inside the folder you store the application. The save data can be found as `masterdeck.json` in the `data` folder.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: First, make a copy of the JSON data file (can be found in `[JAR file location]/data/masterdeck.json`). Next, transfer the copy of data to the respective location of the other computer (`[JAR file location]/data/masterdeck.json`), overwriting any old data files. If done correctly, when you start the app on the other computer, you will observe that the data has been transferred over successfully!

**Q**: Can I rename my saved data file?<br>
**A**: **No**, PowerCards currently only supports the use of `masterdeck.json` as the name of the saved data file.

**Q**: How can I verify if my answer is correct?<br>
**A**: PowerCards operates on a self-testing basis. You can check your answer by writing it down before flipping the card to verify if you got it right or wrong.

**Q**: Can I have two cards with the same question?<br>
**A**: **No**, if the two cards are in the same deck. `QUESTION` field of Card is case-sensitive and cannot be duplicated within the same deck. **However**, two cards with the same question can exist **if they belong to different decks**.

**Q**: Can I have two decks with the same name? <br>
**A**: **No**. The name of the deck is case-sensitive and cannot be duplicated, e.g., if you already have a deck named `Science`, you cannot create another deck named `Science`. However, you can create a deck named `SCIENCE` since `SCIENCE` may be an acronym.

**Q**: What if I would like to include the prefix within my card (question or answer) or deck name? (For example `addCard q\What is q\a a\It means q slash a` should add a card with question `What is q\a` instead of `a`)<br>
**A**: At the moment we do not support that. However, we plan to support this feature in the next iteration. We also like to point out that this is the reason why we use backslash &#92; rather than forward slash `/` for this current iteration as backslash is less commonly use than forward slash.
