## **How to use the User Guide**

### **General formatting conventions**

* Text in [blue](#How-to-use-the-user-guide) are hyperlinks that direct you to the relevant section of the page or other websites.
* Text in **bold** is used to emphasize important details to look out for or to distinguish headers from the rest of the text.
* Text in `code snippets such as this` is used to show inputs and their format.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-info">

* :white_check_mark: **Input Shortcut:**
  Shortened forms of commands which can help increase your efficiency in using PetPal

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-success">

* :bulb: **Note:**
  Information that might be useful to know to enhance your PetPal experience, might not be compulsory to know

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

* :heavy_exclamation_mark: **Caution:**
  Important information to note which might negatively impact your experience in using PetPal as it might cause fatal
  errors

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

* :information_source: **Information**

Information that you need to know

</div>

### **Command formatting conventions:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the information supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. `OWNER_NAME` is a parameter in `add o/OWNER_NAME`, where you can input `add o/John Doe`.
* Parameters in `[]` are optional.<br>
  e.g. `DEADLINE` is an optional parameter in `add o/OWNER_NAME [d/DEADLINE]`, where you can input `add on/John Doe d/Feed dog - 2023-03-27 21:09:09` or just `add n/John Doe`.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG...]` can be used as `t/Pomeranian`, `t/Pomeranian t/Vegetarian` etc.
* `INDEX` represents the index of a specific pet in the PetPal list you are **currently viewing**, which can change based on prior commands executed (e.g. `find`, `remind`)<br>
  e.g. You can use the command `delete INDEX` as `delete 2`.
* Parameters can be in **any order**.<br>
  e.g. You can input either `add o/OWNER_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` or ` add p/PHONE_NUMBER o/OWNER_NAME`.
* Only the last occurrence of a parameter that is expected once will be taken **if you specify it more than once.**<br>
  e.g. Given `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear` and `undo`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Note:

1. The field `n/PET_NAME` is **case-sensitive**. That is `n/Doggo` and `n/doggo` will be treated as 2 different pets.
2. There are certain constraints which might differ for each parameter, please refer to **Figure 1** below for details on each constraint.
3. Pets with the `PET_NAME` **cannot** be created.
4. There can be multiple tags associated with each pet, simply repeat the tag prefix. e.g. `t/Dog t/BichonFrise`

### **Updating**

#### Updating your pet information: `edit`

A pet owner changed their contact information? or did you find out new information about your pet client?

You can edit these changes with the `edit` command. This command can be used to edit: phone numbers, addresses, emails, and tags.

If you accidentally invoked this command with the wrong parameters, you can use the `edit` command to re-edit the wrong fields or
the `undo` command to revert the wrong changes.

**Constraints**

* Edits the pet with the provided index.
* `INDEX` is the index of the pet in the currently displayed list.
* You must provide **at least one** of the optional fields.
* Allows you to update a pet to have the same owner name but a different phone number or, the same number but a different owner name as a current pet in the PetPal.
* Pet profiles are auto-saved in PetPal and are reflected in the PetPal list.
* Cost is constantly being updated in PetPal but the latest information may not be reflected to you. To get the latest information, either click on the pet profile or run a command (e.g. `list` or `l`).

Format: `edit INDEX [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [t/TAG...]`

![update](images/UG/edit_new.png)

Example given: `edit 6 t/GoldenRetriever t/Dog a/Blk 235 Ang Mo Kio Ave 8, #11-312 e/alextoh@gmail.com`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-success">

:bulb: **Note:**

If you wish to add tags to the pet, take note to include all previous tags in the edit, or they will be overridden.

Only the parameters provided will be changed.

</div>

Other examples:

* `edit 2 p/91234567 a/21 Beach Road` Updates the second pet entry's phone number to`91234567`
  and address to `21 Beach Rd`
* `edit 3 t/Dog`. Updates the third pet entry's tag to `Dog`, take note that if the third entry has an existing tag, the
  edit will override the existing tag

#### **Amount indication**

Pet Card information indicates the amount of money your customers owe you for taking good care of their pets!

Cost is calculated based on the initial timestamp input by the user. The cost is updated based on user interaction, clicking the pet card or reopening PetPal!

![](images/UG/amount_new.png)

#### **Changing the cost :** `changecost`

Do some pets cost more to board in your daycare than others? You can use the `changecost` command to
change the parameters for cost calculation for each pet.

Cost is incremented in real-time and is calculated based on `FLAT_RATE + (TIMESTAMP - CURR_TIME * RATE)`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-success">

:bulb: **Note:**

The cost will only update in your PetPal list when you click on the PetPal entry.

The update only applies to the selected PetPal entry.

</div>

Format: `changecost INDEX RATE FLAT_RATE`

![update](images/UG/cc_new.png)

Example given: `changecost 1 0.1 0.5`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-info">

* :white_check_mark: **Input Shortcut:**
  You can also use the shortcut `cc` to replace `changecost`

</div>

Additional example:

* `cc 2 1.0 1.5`

### **Marking a deadline as done:** `mark`

Are you done with a pet's deadline? You can use the `mark` command to mark the deadline as done.

Pets that are already marked will not be highlighted.

Format: `mark INDEX`

Example given: `mark 1`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-success">

:bulb: **Note:**

You should always mark the pet's deadline when you finished it. Otherwise, it will be highlighted as undone.

Pet deadline status will be automatically saved in the form of a `status` field in the `petpal.json` file. `Unmarked` means have not finished yet and `Marked` means already finished.

</div>

#### **Archiving a pet:** `archive`

Sometimes a client may become inactive or stop using your services. To keep a record of the pet whilst not cluttering
your active PetPal list, you can use the `archive` command to move these records to another save file.

Archives the specified pet into the `archive.json` file in the `data` folder.

Note that:

* The specified pet will be removed from your PetPal list.
* The index is based on the **currently displayed** PetPal list, which might change depending on prior commands used
  (e.g. `find`)

Format: `archive INDEX`

![archive](images/UG/archive_new.png)

Example:

* `archive 2` archives the second pet in the currently displayed list in PetPal

#### **Clearing PetPal list:** `clear`

Clears all entries from `PetPal.json`.

Format: `clear`

![clear](images/UG/clear_new.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-warning">

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Important**
If you run this command by accident, you can [undo](#undoing-a-previous-command-undo) the command to restore the previous state of PetPal.

</div>

### **Undo**

#### **Undoing a previous command:** `undo`

Undo the last command executed, only works for supported commands. You can use this if you
make a mistake while using PetPal.

**Constraints**

* The command intended to be undone should be an undoable command.
* Supported commands: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `undo`
* **NOT SUPPORTED** commands: `exit`, `find`, `help`, `list`, `remind`, `changecost`, `archive`

### **Saving the data**

Your PetPal and archive data are both automatically saved after executing any command that changes the data.
This means hassle-free data saving.

### **Editing the data file**

PetPal data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/PetPal.json`. If you are an advanced user, you are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.
Archive data is also in a JSON format and can be found in `[JAR file location]/data/archive.json`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to either data file make its format invalid, PetPal will **discard all data** and start with an empty data file at the next run,
which is **IRREVERSIBLE**.

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Follow these steps to transfer your data to another computer:

1. Find the save folder on the current computer. The save files can be found in the `data` folder created by the app, it should include both `PetPal.json` and `archive.json`
2. Transfer the save file to your new computer.
3. Download the latest release of PetPal from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/releases) on your new computer.
4. Launch PetPal on your new computer and exit.
5. You should see a new `data` folder containing a new `PetPal.json` with a sample. Replace this file with the save file copied over from your old computer.
6. Launch PetPal again. Your data should be there!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-success">

* :bulb: **Note:**
  If you wish to transfer only 1 of the files over, repeat the same steps, and replace the file you want to move, instead of the entire `data` folder

</div>

<br><br>

**Q**: How do I view the entire pet list after a `find` command?

**A**: Run `list` or `l` to view the entire unfiltered list.

<br><br>

**Q**: Why there are some pets highlighted even though the deadline is already passed?

**A**: If you have already done the task, run the `mark` function to mark it as done and remove the highlight.

<br><br>
**Q**: PetPal says the index is invalid even though the pet exists in the PetPal list

**A**: The index of each pet is based on your **currently viewable** pet list index, so if your currently viewable pet list is empty, the index will be invalid<br>
Run `list` or `l` to view all the pets in the list before executing the command again.

<br><br>

**Q**: Why is my pet cost not updating?

**A**: After clicking on a `PetCard` once, the cost will be updated for the first time. To update the cost again, please click on other `PetCards`.
