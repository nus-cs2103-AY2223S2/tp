# 1. Quick start

## 1.1 Installation

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. If you aren't sure of the version, follow these 
[instructions](#4-how-do-i-check-my-java-version).
If you don't have Java downloaded or have an outdated version, download it 
[here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).

2. Download the latest `piedpiper.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Pied Piper.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar piedpiper.jar` command 
to run the application. If you need help on how to navigate the command terminal, check out 
[this](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Folder-in-Cmd#:~:text=The%20%22cd%22%20command%20is%20used,not%20press%20Enter%20just%20yet.&text=Type%20the%20address%20of%20the,the%20folder%20is%20located%20in.)

## 1.2 App overview

### 1.2.1 Types of interfaces

Pied Piper supports 2 types of lists, a `PersonList` and a `TaskList`.

The person list can be viewed using the [list](#214-viewing-persons-view) command.<br>![listExample](images/ListExample.PNG)

The task list can be viewed using the [view](#213-listing-tasks-list) command.<br>![taskViewExample](images/ViewExample.PNG)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 1.2.2 Layout

![appLayout](images/AppLayout.PNG)

**Command Box**: This is where you type in commands to work your way around Pied Piper. A quick summary of commands can 
be found [here](#5-command-summary).

**Message Box**: This is where Pied Piper provides feedback to show what actions have just been done, as well as to 
display error messages if you input the wrong commands.

**Lists**: Depending on whether you chose to display the `PersonList` or the `TaskList`, this window shows you all 
currently stored persons or tasks.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 1.2.3 Key definitions

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.

* All dates must be in the format of `DD/MM/YYYY`. Dates also cannot be from a date before the present date.

* Words in front of `/` are parameter prefixes that need to be included when inputting the parameters.<br>
  e.g. When adding a `todo` task, the format is `todo task/TASK_NAME`. If your task name is 'Homework',
  the full command will be `todo task/Homework`.

* As a result of the above, the character `/` cannot be used in any parameters.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `a/ADDRESS [r/ROLE]` can be used as `a/John street, block 123 r/Member` or as `a/John street, block 123`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `view`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `view 123`, it will be interpreted as `view`.

* Note what the status colours denote:
  * ![blackStatusBar](images/BlackStatusBar.PNG) default colour for status.
  * ![greenStatusBar](images/GreenStausBar.PNG) task has been marked as completed.
  * ![yellowStatusBar](images/YellowStatusBar.PNG) today is the deadline for the task.
  * ![redStatusBar](images/RedStatusBar.PNG) deadline has passed.
