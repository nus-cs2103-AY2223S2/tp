## **Introduction**

<img src="images/MyLibLogo.png">

MyLib is a desktop bookmarking application originally built to serve as a single platform for organising and tracking all the online webnovels and comics that you may be reading. However, its general bookmarking features is more than capable of handling any other bookmarking tasks you might have. This not only includes other types of novels, but also blogs, articles, reddit posts, Youtube videos and anything else that you want to track!

With MyLib, you have the ability to throw all your bookmarks onto a **single platform**, and organise them in a **highly personalized** way via a custom set of tags or labels that you can define on your own.

MyLib is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This means that most of MyLib's features are meant to be accessed through typed commands rather than mouse clicks. However, the commands are simple enough such that typing them out will not be much slower than using a GUI, if at all!

## **Key Definitions**
This section provides explanations of important terms that will be used in this User Guide.

### Bookmark
As a bookmarking application, MyLib naturally uses bookmarks to bookmark your content. While MyLib was originally intended to be used for tracking web novels and comics, it's bookmarking features are general enough that your content can basically be anything.

A bookmark in MyLib contains:
* Title - the title of the content that is being tracked by this bookmark
* Author - the author of the content that is being tracked by this bookmark
* Progress - consists of volume, chapter and page, and is used to track your progress with the content being tracked by this bookmark.
* Genre - the genre your content falls under. More details can be found [here](#genre).
* Rating - to indicate how much you enjoyed the content being tracked by this bookmark.
* Tags - a custom labels attached to a bookmark for custom categorization purposes. More details can be found [here](#tags).
* URL - to hold the URL of the website that the content being tracked by this bookmark is hosted at.

For a bookmark in MyLib, everything except for title and genre is optional.


### Genre
As mentioned in [Bookmark](#bookmark), a genre in a bookmark indicates the genre of the content the bookmark is tracking.

In MyLib, a bookmark's genre may only be selected from a fixed list of genres provided by MyLib.

To find out how to view this fixed list of genres, go [here](#viewing-genres-genre).

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Tags
As mentioned in [Bookmark](#bookmark), tags are custom labels that you can attach to a bookmark to categorize them.

MyLib has a tag list, which is a list of all available tags that can be attached to a bookmark. MyLib provides a default set of tags in this tag list that you can use to tag your bookmarks. In addition, you may also view, add and delete tags from the tag list. Your tag list will be saved along with your bookmarks when you close the application.

The commands to modify your tag list can be found at [Tag Commands](#tag-commands).

## **Commands**
This section provides an in-depth explanation of MyLib's commands. For a quick reference of the available commands, use the [Command Summary](#command-summary) table.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/TITLE`, `TITLE` or name of `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/The Odessey`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TITLE [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/The Odessey t/School` or as `n/The Odessey`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/School`, `t/School t/Literature` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/TITLE a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR n/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `a/John Butcher a/Jim Butcher`, only `a/Jim Butcher` will be taken.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `genre`, `tags` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd bookmark in the library.
* `find n/Chainsaw Man` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st bookmark in the results of the `find` command.

### Editing a bookmark : `edit`

Edits an existing bookmark in the library.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/TITLE] [a/AUTHOR] [p/PROGRESS] [g/GENRE] [r/RATING] [u/URL] [t/TAG]…​`

* You can remove all the bookmark’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

### Sorting bookmarks : `sort`

Sorts the list of bookmarks by ratings in either ascending or descending order.

Format : sort [ORDER]

* ORDER is case-sensitive. e.g. `sort ASC` does not work.

Examples:
* sort asc
* sort desc

### Locating bookmarks by specific fields: `find`

Find bookmarks whose specified fields contain the given keywords.

`find` helps you to find bookmarks whose specified fields contain the given keywords. You can use this when you
want to filter out certain bookmarks from your large list of bookmarks. `find` allows you to search for bookmarks
using the title, author, genre and/or tags of a bookmark.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can use the `list` command to get back the bookmarks that you have filtered out after `find`.
</div>

Format: `find [n/TITLE] [a/AUTHOR] [g/GENRE] [t/TAG]…​`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* The search for name and author is case-insensitive. e.g. `rankers` will match `Rankers`
* The search for genre and tag is case-sensitive. e.g. `fantasy` will not match `Fantasy`
* The valid values for each item is the same as the [`add` command](#adding-a-bookmark-add).
* The order of the keywords matter. e.g. `Guide Rankers` will not match `Rankers Guide`
* Only the fields of the specified prefixes are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Ranker` will not match `Ranker's`.
* The search for tags will return any bookmark that has a tag that matches the given tag.
* If multiple tags are provided, any bookmarks containing at least one of the tags would be returned.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
