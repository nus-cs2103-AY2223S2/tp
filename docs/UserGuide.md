## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/LinkedIn`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/COMPANY_NAME [l/LOCATION]` can be used as `n/LinkedIn l/Clementi` or as `n/LinkedIn`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[r/REVIEW]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `r/Close to MRT`, `r/Close to MRT t/Kind, inclusive bosses and colleagues` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/COMPANY_NAME j/JOB_TITLE`, `j/JOB_TITLE n/COMPANY_NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `l/Clementi l/Changi`, only `l/Changi` will be taken.

* Note that the following are reserved keyword in InternEase, and including these characters in the company name, job title,
  review, and other fields may lead to unspecified behaviour:
    * `n/`, `j/`, `r/`, `p/`, `q/`, `l/`, `s/`, `note/`, `rate/`, `reflect/`, `e/`, `by/`, `c/`, `d/`, `rs/`, `cl/`, `before/`, `after/`, `from/`, `to/`, 

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`,`clear`, and `remind`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* >**Note:** <br/>
  > InternEase has 4 window interfaces which include the internship application list, the todo list, the note list and the task list. 
  > All the commands can be used in any interface. If the command for a different interface is executed in current interface, the current interface will switch to the respective interface and display the result of the command.
