#### Welcome to CoDoc, a desktop app for students in NUS to connect with each other for the benefit of their course of study.
CoDoc is **optimized for** use via your **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the **benefits of** a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. 
If you can type fast, CoDoc can get your **contact management** tasks **done faster** than traditional GUI apps.

CoDoc is more than just a traditional contact management app. Save useful information such as **modules taken** or
**skills possessed** by a person to greatly improve your **networking experience**.

**Spend less time** _keeping track of your contacts_ or _searching through chats_, and **more time** making _meaningful
connections_ and _accomplishing your goals_!

### Navigating CoDoc

If it's your first time using this program, the starting screen could seem a little overwhelming. Not to worry, let's familiarize ourselves with the different parts of the CoDoc interface together. We recommend **maximizing** the program window to have a clearer view. This way you can see more content as well.

Below is the breakdown of the CoDoc screen:

![navigation](images/navigation.png)

- **Menu Bar:** if you ever feel stuck, you can always click on the `Help` button here or enter `help` in the command box. 
- **Command Box:** this is where you can type in commands.
- **Result Display:** shows the result of a command that you have executed.
- **Person List Panel:** here are your contacts in CoDoc.
- **Course List Panel:** you can refer to this list when adding a person.
- **Info Panel:** displays information about a selected person, such as their contact details, modules, and skills, which are presented as tabs.

### CoDoc Tutorial: Your first steps

Now that you know how to navigate CoDoc, we recommend you try the following steps to familiarize with 
available features of CoDoc.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 1. Adding a person

You probably notice a list of contacts already into the database. How can I add one on my own?

Let's say you got to know Bob in school and want to add him to CoDoc. You find out that **Bob**, is a **year 2** student,
taking **Computer Science** and his email address is **e0823741@u.nus.edu**. Here is how you can use CoDoc's
[Add command](#2-adding-a-person--add) to do so:

In the command box, enter the command `add n/Bob y/2 c/6 e/e0823741@u.nus.edu` and press the `enter` key.
This will add a new person named Bob to our contact list.

![adding-bob](images/UG-tutorial/adding-bob.png)

After executing the command, we see that Bob has been added below the list.

> <b>Understanding the Command:</b> As you can see, we first specified the <code>add</code> command, followed by the <em>prefix</em> <code>n/</code> and the <em>name</em> that we want to add i.e. <code>Bob</code>. The same goes for the <em>year</em>, <em>course</em> and <em>email</em>. This <code>n/</code> and <code>Bob</code> pair, is the <em>prefix</em> and <em>parameter</em> pair that occurs frequently in other commands too. Refer to [Glossary](#glossary) for more info.

<div class="span" class="alert alert-danger">  
:exclamation: <b>Caution:</b> You must specify minimally, the person's <i>name</i>, <i>email</i>, <i>year</i> and <i>course</i> when adding a person.
</div>

You may have noticed we entered `c/6` and wonder why the parameter for _course_ was `6` instead of `Computer Science`.

To save time typing out the full course and also standardize formatting, we have coded the command so that you just
have to type its _index_ as the parameter, which you can refer to the [**Course List Panel**](#navigating-codoc) to identify. 

If you want to, you can add additional details of the person such as _GitHub username_, _LinkedIn profile URL_, _modules_ and _skills_.

Related: [Adding a person: `add`](#2-adding-a-person--add)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: <b>Note:</b> Profile pictures shown here might not be identical to yours as they are randomised.
</div>

<br>

#### 2. Viewing a person

Now that you have added Bob into CoDoc, you can view his details by using the [View command](#3-viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view).
This will load Bob's details into the [**Info Panel**](#navigating-codoc).

To do so, let's first identify Bob's _index_. From the [**Person List Panel**](#navigating-codoc), we can tell that Bob is
numbered `8` in this example. This is his _index_. Now enter `view 8` into the command box. His _contact_ details will then be shown in the **Info Panel**.

![viewing-bob](images/UG-tutorial/viewing-bob.png)

You may try loading another person's details by using different _index_ (e.g. `view 2`). 

<div class="span" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: <b>Tip:</b> CoDoc also supports GUI, so you can just click the person in the list to view his details.
</div>

Remember that we said CoDoc offers more than just a traditional contact management app? So far, you have only viewed
the _detailed contacts_ tab, showing basic contact details.

Now let's try viewing other tabs in **Info Panel**. 
To do so, enter `view m` in the command box. This will show Bob's **modules taken** under _detailed modules_ tab.

![viewing-bobs-modules](images/UG-tutorial/viewing-bobs-modules.png)

Note that you do not see anything of value, and that is because we have not added any modules Bob has taken so far
(don't worry, we will show how you can add onto this list below).

You can enter `view s` as well to view Bob's _skills_ to see a similar empty list, or enter `view c` to go back to Bob's
contact information.

<div class="span" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: <b>Tips:</b> CoDoc also supports GUI, so you can click on the name of different tabs to switch between tabs.
</div>

**Related:** [Viewing a person/Changing tabs: `view`](#3-viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view)

<br>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


#### 3. Editing a person's details

To use CoDoc to its fullest potential, you can add Bob's **modules taken** or **skills possessed** to the database.

Let's say you met Bob while taking _CS2101_ and _CS2103T_ modules. To update this information in the database, you can use
CoDoc's [Edit command](#4-editing-a-person--edit).

First make sure that Bob is shown in the right panel using the View command. In this example, we can enter `view 8` to
do so.

>**Why is this step necessary?:** Editing only works on the person shown in the info panel. Make sure you are viewing
> the correct person with the [View command](#3-viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view) (or with a click) before you enter
> the [Edit command](#4-editing-a-person--edit).

After you see Bob in the **Info Panel**, enter `edit m/ay2223s2 cs2101 m/ay2223s2 cs2103t` in the command box. 

![editing-bobs-modules](images/UG-tutorial/editing-bobs-modules.png)

You can now see that Bob's list of **modules taken** has been updated to contain modules _CS2101_ and _CS2103T_
(enter `view m` if you're not on the _modules_ tab).

<div class="span" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: <b>Tip:</b> You do not have to be on <em>modules</em> tab to edit it as long as you are viewing the correct person (i.e. you can be viewing Bob's contacts as you add modules). However, switching to <em>modules</em> tab will definitely make it easy for you to edit <b>modules taken</b>!
</div>

If you want to save the hassle of editing _modules_ only after adding a person, you can include them in the initial
[Add command](#2-adding-a-person--add) to do so.

As the name suggests, [Edit command](#4-editing-a-person--edit) is capable of editing other details of the person such as
_name_, _year_, _GitHub username_, etc. Use this to fix your mistakes or update your database as you progress your studies!

**Related:** [Adding a person: `add`](#2-adding-a-person--add),
[Viewing a person: `view`](#3-viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view),
[Editing a person: `edit`](#4-editing-a-person--edit)

<br>

#### 4. Finding a person

You have been using CoDoc for months and have expanded the database greatly. You realize that finding a person in the
contacts is getting increasingly difficult and wishes there is an easier way to do so.

That is exactly what CoDoc's [Find command](#5-finding-a-person--find) is for! Use this to filter people in the contacts.

Let's try to find people that are taking/have taken CS2103T. To do so, we have to first clear existing filters if they
have been applied. We can do this by entering `list` into the command box. This shows us all existing contacts in CoDoc. 

Then enter `find m/cs2103t`. This will make **Person List Panel** show only the people who have CS2103T in their module
list. On successful execution, you will see something like below.

![finding-cs2103t](images/UG-tutorial/finding-cs2103t.png)

If you tried the examples for previous commands, Bob would be shown as well.

Our `find` command is pretty powerful; it works for other attributes, like _year_, _skills_, etc. and you can find by
multiple attributes. To learn more, look at [Finding a person: `find`](#5-finding-a-person--find).

**Related docs:** [Finding a person: `find`](#5-finding-a-person--find), [Listing all persons/Resetting filters: `list`](#6-listing-all-personsresetting-filters--list)

### **Congrats! You have completed the tutorial 🎉** 

The pre-existing contacts are just examples for you to mess with. When you are ready, enter `clear` in the command box to clear all contacts and start off with a fresh database.

<div class="span" class="alert alert-danger"> 
:exclamation: <b>Caution:</b> Be careful when using the <code>clear</code> command, it will not ask twice before wiping your database!
</div>

If you need more info on the usage of each command, refer to the relevant sections below.

## Notes about the command format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be **supplied by you**. \
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are **optional**. \
  e.g. `n/NAME [s/SKILL]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/Python` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used **multiple times including zero times**. \
  e.g. `[m/MODULE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/AY2223S2 CS2103T`, `m/AY2122S1 CS1101S m/AY2223S2 CS2103T` etc.
* Parameters can be **in any order**. \
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken**. \
  e.g. if you specify `g/johnny g/john`, only `g/john` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. \
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

  * e.g. `find m/AY2223S1 CS2103`: load all person with `AY2223S1 CS2103` in their module list including `AY2223S1 CS2103T` and `AY2223S1 CS2103R` <br> <br>
  * <div class="span" class="alert alert-success">:bulb: <b>Tip:</b> You can omit ACADEMIC_YEAR as a constraint. E.g. <code>find m/CS2103</code> will load all person with <code>CS2103</code>,<code>CS2103T</code> and <code>CS2103R</code> regardless of ACADEMIC_YEAR in their module list</div>
  * <div class="span" class="alert alert-success">:bulb: <b>Tip:</b> You can input as many MODULES and ACADEMIC_YEAR MODULES as you want separated by a space. E.g. <code>find m/cs1101 cs1231 AY2223S1 cs2040 AY2223S2 cs2090 cs3230</code> will load all persons that have taken <br>

**Example:**
- Start by executing `find y/2` to find all person from year 2 <br> <br> ![UiFind_02](images/UiFind_02_2.png) <br> <br>
- Next, execute `find m/cs1101 s/java c` to further narrow down the filtered list thereby **stacking the constraints** <br> <br> ![UiFind_03](images/UiFind_03_02.png) <br> <br>
- Finally, use `list` to get back the unfiltered list

## Data Management
**Q: How do I save my person list?**

**A:** CoDoc automatically saves your person list after every successful `add`, `edit` and `clear`.

<br>

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?**

**A:** Install CoDoc on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CoDoc home folder.

<br>

**Q: Where is the data file stored?**

**A:** CoDoc data are saved as a JSON file at ***[JAR file location]*****/data/codoc.json**. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div class="span" class="alert alert-danger">  
:exclamation: <b>Caution:</b> If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, CoDoc will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q: I have added a person with wrong details. How do I change it?**

**A:** Use CoDoc's [Edit command](#4-editing-a-person--edit) to update the details. If you have also forgotten to add certain
details, you may use the same command to add them (e.g. `edit m+/AY2223S2 CS2101` to add module _CS2101_).

<br>

**Q: My edit command is not working/changes are not shown.**

**A:** Check that you have entered the command in correct format and the command result shown in the **Result Display** is not
showing any errors.

<br>

**Q: My edit command is editing the wrong person.**

**A:** Edit command works on the current person you are viewing. Change the viewed person with the [View command](#3-viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view)
and view the correct person you want to edit before entering the command.

<br>

**Q: Why is it `find c/COURSE` and not `c/COURSE_INDEX` like `add` and `edit`?**

**A:** This is done as it speeds up the adding and editing process since there is no need for you to manually keep track of how courses are inputted—CS vs Computer Science.
Also, this avoids clashing acronyms such as CS which could be interpreted as Chinese Studies too.

<br>

**Q: My find command is not showing the correct list of people.**

**A:** This could be because there is an existing list of filters before you entered the [Find command](#5-finding-a-person--find).
Try clearing all filters with [List command](#6-listing-all-personsresetting-filters--list) then re-enter the Find command.

<br>

**Q: I cannot find the course I want to add in the Course List Panel.**

**A:** We are currently working to add as many courses as possible. Meanwhile, you would have to assign any other courses to the person and remember it.

<br>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Q: How can I change the profile picture for my contacts?**

**A:** As of right now, profile pictures cannot be edited. They are randomly picked from a pool of 50 avatar icons when a person is added. However, we will be rolling out future updates that will allow you to change the profile pictures.
