NeoBook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, it can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Apart from being your all-encompassing address book, NeoBook also has an Events function for you to keep track of your daily schedule.

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `neobook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your NeoBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar neobook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `edit 3 n/pierce` : Edits the 3rd contact's name on the current list to pierce
   
   * `tab 2` : Navigates to the events tab
   
   * `addevent d/Do Work! s/2023-04-10 1200 e/2023-04-10 1400 r/Daily` : Adds an event with a description of "Do work!" on 2023-04-10 from 1200 to 1400 and will recur daily.

   * `tab 1` : Navigates to the contacts tab

## How to read the User Guide

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

####  :information_source: Notes about the command format:<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `t/TAG…​` means that we can exclude the tag prefix completely or use it as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items in `{ }` and have a `…​` followed after them must be used at least once, and can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. For `editevent INDEX {PREFIX/PARAMETER}…​` will allow `editevent 1 r/Weekly` or `editevent 2 d/Do work r/Daily`, but not `editevent 1`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter, which isn't a FieldGroup, is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. Since Phone is just a normal field, if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.<br>
  e.g. Since Modules is a FieldGroup, if you specify `mt/CS1231S mt/CS2040S`, all will be taken unlike the previous example.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

IMPT: If you want to add multiple tags or modules in one statement,
every tag or module has to have its corresponding prefix.

Only modules that are a part of NUS' mod systems will be allowed. This is
to prevent any messiness and also allows for future syncing with NUSMods.

### Editing a contact's details : `edit`

Learnt something new about your friend? Or perhaps he/she changed a particular detail?

Use this command to edit his/her details easily!

#### Syntax

`edit INDEX {PREFIX/PARAMETER}…​`


#### Description

`INDEX` refers to the index of the contact you wish to edit in the current displayed list.


For the following fields, they are considered a `FieldGroup`.
* Modules
* Tags

A `FieldGroup` can contain many parameters in that single field.
When using edit, the command looks for each parameter in the `FieldGroup`:
* If the parameter already exists in the `FieldGroup` it will be removed.
* Otherwise, the parameter will be added into the `FieldGroup`.

#### Important requirements

`INDEX` must be a **positive integer** (must be greater than 0).

All the fields are optional. However, at least one field must be provided.

####  Examples Usages
The first contact has `CS2103T`, `MA2001` and `GEA1000` as its modules.
* `edit 1 mt/CS2103T` removes CS2103T from the Modules field since it is already a part of its Modules field.
* So the first contact in your Neobook will have `MA2001` and `GEA1000` as its only modules
<br/>

The second contact has the following tags `Friend`, `Amazing Coder`
* `edit 2 t/10x Coder t/Intern Friend` adds both `10x Coder` and `Intern Friend` as tags to the contact as neither existed in its Tags field.
* So the second contact in your NeoBook would have `Friend`, `Amazing Coder`, `10x Coder` and `Intern Friend` in its Tags field.

|--------|---------------------------------|-----------|

## Events Features

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

####  :information_source: Notes about the command format:<br>

Events have 4 components to them
- Description
- StartDateTime
- EndDateTime
- Recurrence

Events will automatically update to their next earliest occurrence for recurring events.

One-time events will be automatically grayed out once the event has been passed.

In the case where a one-time event is supposed to be greyed out (i.e. the current time is 2359 and the event is set to end at 2358 on the same day), then inputting any command will update the event to grey.

</div>

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Adding an Event : `addevent`

Want to keep track of current events?

Use this command to add events into your Event Section of your NeoBook.

#### Syntax

#### Description

| Prefix   | Name of Field                 | Optional? |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| d        | Description of Event          | No        |
| s        | Start Date and Time of Event  | No        |
| e        | End Date and Time of Event    | No        |
| r        | Recurrence Interval           | Yes       |

You can add 2 types of Events:
1. One Time Events
2. Recurring Events (of various Intervals):
    * Daily Events

    * If the month has only 30 days, inputting `31-MM-YYYY` will get bumped down to `30-MM-YYYY` for both `START DATE` and `END DATE`
    * `2400` is also accepted as an input for `START TIME` and `END TIME`, this will roll the date input by the user to the next day
        e.g. Inputting `2023-03-10 2400` will be accepted and will be rolled over to `2023-03-11 0000` instead.

2. `INTERVAL OF RECURRENCE` doesn't need to be specified to add an event
    * If unspecified, Event will be automatically added as a `One Time Event`.

#### Extra Notes
* If the year is not a Leap Year, inputting `29-02-YYYY` will get bumped down to `28-02-YYYY` for both `START DATE` and `END DATE`
* If the month has only 30 days, inputting `31-MM-YYYY` will get bumped down to `30-MM-YYYY` for both `START DATE` and `END DATE`
* `2400` is also accepted as an input for `START TIME` and `END TIME`, this will roll the date input by the user to the next day
  e.g. Inputting `2023-03-10 2400` will be accepted and will be rolled over to `2023-03-11 0000` instead.

#### Example Usages
* `addevent d/CS2103T Lecture s/2023-03-30 1600 e/2023-03-30 1800 r/weekly` will add a Weekly Recurring Event of CS2103T Lecture that occurs from 1600 to 1800, starting on 2023-03-30.

## User Features

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Introduction

The user features are reflected under the 'Me' tab (tab 3).

Here, you can edit personal information about yourself, the user, which can be used in future features to streamline contact exchanging.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


### Editing the details of the user : `edituser`

Want to change one of your own details, perhaps something was out of date?

Use this command to edit your details easily!

#### Syntax

`edituser {PREFIX/PARAMETER}…​`


#### Description

For the following fields, they are considered a `FieldGroup`.
* Modules
* Tags

A `FieldGroup` can contain many parameters in that single field.
When using edit, the command looks for each parameter in the `FieldGroup`:
* If the parameter already exists in the `FieldGroup` it will be removed.
* Otherwise, the parameter will be added into the `FieldGroup`.
    * e.g. `edituser mt/CS2103T` removes CS2103T from the Modules field of a contact if it already exists and adds it if it does not.
    * e.g. `edituser t/10x Coder t/Intern Friend`
        * For a contact with none of the above tags, both `10x Coder` and `Intern Friend` will be added as tags
        * For a contact which has `10x Coder` as a tag, he will have the `10x Coder` removed and `Intern Friend` added as a tag.

| Prefix | Name of Field                   | Optional? |
|--------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| n      | Name                            | Yes       |

## Data

### Saving the data

NeoBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need for you to save manually.

### Editing the data file

NeoBook data are saved as JSON files. Two of which will be of interest to you:
- `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
- `[JAR file location]/data/userdata.json`.

You are welcome to update the data directly by editing that data file.
However, be careful when directly editing the tagged contacts in `userdata.json`. It may cause the person to become unlinked from the event completely.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If you edit the taggedPerson in User data, beware that you may end up unlinking the person from any changes to the original contact in NeoBook
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NeoBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NeoBook home folder.

**Q**: My NeoBook doesn't seem to be showing up on my screen upon load. What should I do?<br>
**A**: If everything is working fine (i.e. no crashes are happening and the app starts up properly), then a likely cause is that you were using a second screen. NeoBook automatically saves its last position in your screen and starts up in that same position. If you were using NeoBook on a second screen and aren't using a second screen now, the problem is likely due to you closing NeoBook at a position on the second screen. This will lead to NeoBook opening at the same position as before, but off your screen where you can't interact with it. To remedy this, go to the `preferences.json` file in NeoBook and change `windowCoordinates` to something that is within your first screen. (Typically `x:50` and `y:50` works fine).

## Future Plans

1. Making the following fields accept multiple parameters instead of just one. 
   1. Since the groundwork was completed in the Tags and Modules fields, we considered it trivial to implement the rest of these fields to accept multiple parameters.
      - Phone
      - Address    
      - Email
      - Race
      - Communication Channels
      - Major
      - Faculty

2. Adding better input validation to Phone, Email and Address fields, such as minimum lengths or certain formats.

3. Adding duplicate names support, which is available in most contact lists.

4. Making the user's events be able to import other contact's events.
   1. Since the User is a form of Contact, it is once again trivial to extend the same functionality to other contacts

5. Making NeoBook accept more symbols and emojis.
   1. Currently, the validation regex for all the fields for contacts do not accept special symbols (and also do not render them properly). In the future, we will attempt to add-in support for this.

6. Switching to the relevant tab when a command is executed.
   1. Using commands for contacts in the events tab and vice versa may not show any visible changes, causing confusion in whether the user did anything.
   2. Certain commands should bring the user to the relevant tab, if they are not currently in said tab (e.g. `list` should navigate to the contacts tab).

7. Enhancing the `select` command to accept parameters beyond just the index of the contact.
   1. User cannot see the indices of contacts further down the list, and needs to scroll.
   2. The `select` command can integrate `find` functionality.

8. Splitting the description field of events into title and description fields, so as not to clutter the UI with long descriptions.
