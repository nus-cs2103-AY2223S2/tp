## 1.3 Features

There are 3 main data types in SudoHR:
* [Employees](#321-employee)
* [Departments](#322-department)
* [Leaves](#323-leave)

SudoHR allows you to manage all of these by:
1. Creating, updating, listing and deleting of the 3 data types.
2. Adding/Removing employees in departments/leaves.
3. Applying different filters on the data.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:exclamation: **TIP:**
SudoHR can access the data at breakneck speeds, up to 10,000 employees, 10,000 departments, 10,000 leaves
and 10,000 tags!
</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **2. Quick Start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `sudohr.jar`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar sudohr.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/UiPreview.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `exit` : Exits the app.
    * `help` : Brings up the list of commands for reference

6. Refer to the [Command](#4-commands) below for details of each command.

# **3. Quick Reference Guide**

## 3.1. Layout

![Screenshot of SudoHR app](images/UiLayout.png)

[//]: # (<-- Insert labelled UI here -->)
Our app interface consists of 5 main components:
1. Command line
2. Result display
3. Leave section
4. Employee section
5. Department section

### 3.1.1 Command line
The command line box located at the top of the application window serves to receive your typed inputs.

To start typing a command, move your cursor over to the command line and click it.

### 3.1.2 Result display
Underneath the command line is the result display. This text box displays necessary information when executing
commands.

### 3.1.3 Employees
Next to the Departments panel is the Employees section. This panel displays all the information regarding your 
employees. The information shown include the employee id, email, phone number, address and tags given to the
employee.

### 3.1.4 Departments
The leftmost panel is the Departments section. Here you can view the status of the departments in your
company. The main data displayed is the number of employees in each department.

### 3.1.5 Leaves
The last panel on the right is the Leaves section. On this panel, you can view the dates in which employees have
applied for leave. Each leave date would contain the number of employees who applied leaves on that day.


## 3.2. Key definitions

[//]: # (GENERAL FORMAT OF DATA TYPE DEFINITION:)

[//]: # (1. Explain big idea)
[//]: # (2. Explain fields)
[//]: # (3. Explain constraints)

### 3.2.1. Employee

Employees can be added to SudoHR to better track their data, such as their leaves and the departments that they 
belong to,  as well as easy retrieval of information.

An employee possesses the following attributes:
1. Employee ID
2. Name
3. Phone Number
4. Email Address
5. (Home) Address
6. [Optional] Tags

Employees are identified by their IDs. An employee's ID is a unique identification number assigned by the company.
So, no two employees should share the same ID.

Similarly, email address and phone number are fields that belong to a single employee. 
SudoHR enforces uniqueness for these two fields as well. However, do note that emails are case-sensitive.

You cannot add an employee that share any of the following fields with a different employee in SudoHR:
1. ID
2. Phone Number
3. Email Address

### 3.2.2. Department

A department is made up of a group of employees. A department can have many employees and an employee can be in many 
departments.

Every employee in a department must be unique.

The following attributes are stored for each department:
1. Department Name

Departments are unique by name and case-sensitive. You cannot add more than one
department of the same name.

### 3.2.3. Leave

[//]: #
A leave represents a day on which an employee would be absent from the company. It is not possible for the employee to take more than 1 leave in a day.

The following attributes are stored for each leave:
1. Date

Each employee can only take a leave once per day. Leaves are unique by date.

### 3.2.4. Prefixes

[//]: # (Explain prefixes in the command and their corresponding placeholders)

Prefixes are delimiters to differentiate between different types of input.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**NOTE:**
There is currently no prefix for **KEYWORD** and **OLD_DEPARTMENT_NAME**.
</div>

[//]: # (Talk about their constraints, type, format, etc)

## 3.3. Command Format

[//]: # (Explain the general command format: command, prefixes, placeholders)

Commands are what you will work with in SudoHR, let's learn what a command is made of:

![CommandFormat](images/CommandFormat.png)

It consists of:
1. Command - The name of the command
2. Prefixes - The identifiers for the various input values, different commands require different prefixes
3. Placeholders - The actual input values for the command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **NOTE:**
1. For the commands in this section, the order in which the prefixes (if any) are placed does not matter.
2. If duplicated prefixes are provided, only the argument associated with the last instance of the same prefix will 
   be processed by the parser.
</div>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **4. Commands**

## 4.1. Employee Commands


### 4.1.1. Adding an employee: `add`

To add and store an employee to the application, we can use the add command, 
which takes in as input values an employee ID, name, phone number, email, 
address, and a list of tags that can be used to store auxiliary information
about the individual.


Format: `add id/ID n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **TIP:**
An employee can have any number of unique tags (including 0). To add multiple tags, 
just add more `[t/TAG]` to the end of the command, separated by a space.
</div>

Examples:
* `add id/123 n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Residences p/1234 5678 t/intern t/vegan`
* `add id/777 n/John Doe p/9876 5432 a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 e/johnd@example.com t/vegan t/intern`

![result for 'list'](images/UiListCommand.png)

### 4.1.3. Editing an employee : `edit`

Edits an existing employee in SudoHR. The leave section will be updated to show all leaves. The employee section will be updated to show all employees.

Format: `edit eid/EMPLOYEE_ID [id/NEW_ID] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the employee identified by its employee ID. ID is the unique identifier for the employee. The employee must exist in SudoHR.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When an employee ID is edited, the employee will be identified by its new ID and another employee can assume the old ID.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the employees will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the employee’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.
* The edit command can be applied on any employee in SudoHR regardless of current list view.

Examples:
* `edit eid/10 id/23 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the ID, phone number and email address of the employee with ID 10 to
  `23`, `91234567`, and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit eid/2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the employee with ID 2 to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

# **5. FAQ**

**Q**: There seems to be many commands and prefixes to remember! Is there an easy way to remember them?<br>
**A**: We understand how the short form command names may be difficult to remember, but don't worry. We have thus created a command summary here in the user guide for you in [section 4.6](#46-command-summary)! <br>
This list is also available on the app, which can be accessed with the `help` function or by clicking the help tab on the top right corner of the window.
