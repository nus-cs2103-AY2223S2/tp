# Introduction

Welcome to the *Fish Ahoy! User Guide*! <br>

*Fish Ahoy!* Is a **desktop app for managing your fish, fish tanks, and relevant tasks, optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br>

*Fish Ahoy!* **streamlines** the fish keeping experience by helping you keep track of your many **fishes**, **tanks** and
**weekly tasks**, such as feeding and cleaning.

*Fish Ahoy!* **simplifies** commands to revolve around **fish**, **tank** and **task**. When you want to, for example,
perform an action on **tanks**, the commands all begin with `tank`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using this guide

This guide will explain how you can use *Fish Ahoy!* for your own fish keeping activities. It is designed to
cater to all levels of fish keeping expertise, from novice to expert fish keepers. It does not assume any prior
knowledge of fish keeping, only the simplest components of an aquarium such as a tank, fish, and basic fish keeping
equipment.

For **new users**, follow our [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start) below to get started with your fish-keeping journey with *Fish Ahoy!*.

For **amateur users**, choose a feature from our [table of contents](#table-of-contents) above to find answers and get step-by-step instructions on how to make

5. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   Some examples:
  * `fish add n/Bobby lfd/01/01/2023 15:00 s/Guppy fi/0d5h tk/1`: Add a fish named Bobby to your fish book. Its last fed date, species, feeding interval and tank are specified with the `lfd/`, `s/`, `fi/` and `tk/` prefixes respectively.
  * `fish delete 1`: Deletes the first fish shown in the [centre panel of the interface](#about-the-interface).
  * `tank view 1`: View all fishes and tasks regarding the first tank in the [left panel of the interface](#about-the-interface).


6. Refer to [About the Interface](#about-the-interface) below for details on the interface.
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# About the Interface

The *Fish Ahoy!* interface consists of three main components, the **Command Line**, **Alerts**, and **Panels**,
and two buttons, **File** and **Help**.

![Ui](images/UiIntro.png)

The **Command Line** is where you can enter various commands to enter information into *Fish Ahoy!*.
Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command!

The **Alerts** will display the results of each command, and display additional help specific to the command.

> :bulb: Tip: If you are unsure of the command format, simply enter the command type you want to use, e.g. `fish`, followed by the command action
you would like to use, e.g. `add`. Information on prefixes will be displayed in the Alerts!<br>

The **Panels** will display all the information on your Tanks, Fishes and Tasks. The leftmost panel displays tanks, centre panel display fishes and the right panel displays tasks These panels will automatically update
whenever you enter a command. Try it out!

The **File** button will present a menu where you can exit the application. Exiting from the application using
Windows/Mac OS native close buttons are also fine.

The **Help** button will present a menu where you can display the *Fish Ahoy! User Guide*. If you require extra information,
do use this to redirect you to our user guide!

## Tank Interface

A sample Tank item is shown below. For each Tank you add in *Fish Ahoy!*, you have to add a
[Description]((#description)). A [Tank Index](#index-parameters) is then automatically assigned to the tank.
The **Number of fish** will be automatically updated whenever you add/delete a fish from this tank in *Fish Ahoy!*
The [Ammonia](#tank-ammonia-level-reading-alammonia_level), [Temperature](#tank-temperature-reading-tptemperature) and
[pH](#tank-ph-reading-phph) are generated from [readings](#tank-readings) that you add to *Fish Ahoy!*

![Ui](images/UiTank.png)


> :bulb: Tip: Fluctuations in tank conditions can lead to a lot of stress for your fish. The handy charts displayed for [Ammonia](#tank-ammonia-level-reading-alammonia_level), [Temperature](#tank-temperature-reading-tptemperature) and
[pH](#tank-ph-reading-phph) can let you know at a glance if your levels are stable! 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Fish Interface

A sample Fish item is shown below. Each Fish you add in *Fish Ahoy!* has multiple [parameters](#parameters-br), such as
[Name](#name-nname), [Species](#species-sspecies), [Last Fed Date](#last-fed-date-lfdlast_fed_date),
[Feeding Interval](#feeding-interval-fifeeding_interval), which [Tank](#tank-tktank_index) it is in and what
[Tags](#tags-tgtag) it has. There is also a [Fish Index](#index-parameters) which is automatically assigned to the fish.
The **Fish Icon** is matched to the [Species](#species-sspecies) of the fish!

# *Fish Ahoy!* Commands

In general, the command format is as follows:<br>
`<COMMAND TYPE> <COMMAND ACTION> <PARAMETERS>`
> :information_source: Additional information: `list` commands do not follow this format, but are of format `list <COMMAND TYPE>`

## Command types and actions
* Command types
  * There are 3 command types. They are the `tank`, `fish` and `task` command types
  * They specify what they modify. `tank` commands modify tanks, `fish` commands modify fish and `task` commands modify tasks
* Command actions
  * These specify what the command does. For example, `tank add` adds a tank to *Fish Ahoy!*.

## Parameters <br>

* Parameters are additional pieces of information a command needs to perform its action.
  * For example, in the `tank add` command, a description parameter `d/<DESCRIPTION>` is needed

### Index parameters
* Used as parameters for commands with `delete`, `edit` and `view` actions
* Index parameters are **positive integers** (1, 2, 3...)
* Index parameters do not require a prefix. For example, the command is as follows: `tank delete 1`
* In the features section, index parameters will be as such: `<XXX_INDEX>`, and `XXX` can be `TANK`, `FISH` or `TASK`
> :exclamation: Warning: Ensure that the index you input corresponds to an existing item.
> <br> Look at the [respective panels](#about-the-interface) for the index of the type of object you want to refer to.

![Ui](images/UiIndex.png)

### Prefix parameters
* Used as parameters for commands with `add`, `edit` and `addReadings` actions
* Prefix parameters require a prefix. For example, the command is as follows: `tank add d/<TANK_NAME>`
* In the features section, prefix parameters will be as such: `X/<CONTENT>` where `X` is a valid prefix and `<CONTENT>` is the content of this parameter, subject to its constraints
* You can only have multiple values for tag prefixes `tg/<TAG>`. All other prefixes can only have 1 value. 

> :information_source: Additional information: If you have multiple prefix parameters for the same prefix, only the last one will be used.
> <br>For example: `tank add d/Tank 1 d/Tank 2` will create a tank called 'Tank 2'.

> :information_source: Additional information: Alphanumeric parameters are case-sensitive!
> <br>For Example: `d/Freshwater tank` is different from `d/freshwater tank`

> :bulb: Tip: Redundant spaces will be removed automatically for prefix parameters

# Features

## Tanks

Tanks form the basis of *Fish Ahoy!*, as most, if not all our activities revolve around them. Aquarium tanks are the
first requirement of fish keeping. (Can't have a fish without a tank!) Similarly, *Fish Ahoy!* also requires you to add
a tank first, before allowing you to add in any fishes. These tanks directly represent your tanks in real life, so
customize them with their own names and add in their respective fishes!
In the list, each tank has an [index](#index-parameters). Use these indexes to perform certain operations on them.
<br>
## Tank readings

If the species of fish you are keeping require close monitoring of environmental conditions, this feature is for you. Each
tank keep tracks of 3 types of reading levels- ammonia level, pH and temperature. Use the following commands
to log down the respective readings.

Currently, there are seven command actions of type tank:
* [Adding a tank `tank add`](#adding-a-tank-tank-add)
* [Deleting a tank `tank delete`](#deleting-a-tank-tank-delete)
* [Editing a tank `tank edit`](#editing-a-tank-tank-edit)
* [Feeding a tank `tank feed`](#feeding-a-tank-tank-feed)
* [Viewing a tank `tank view`](#viewing-a-tank-tank-view)
* [Adding a set of readings to a tank `tank addReadings`](#adding-a-set-of-readings-tank-addreadings)
* [Deleting a most recent set of readings of a tank `tank delLastReadings`](#deleting-the-most-recent-set-of-readings-tank-dellastreadings)

### Adding a tank: `tank add`

You can add a tank to *Fish Ahoy!* with the `tank add` command.

Use this command to add your own tank with a customized name to *Fish Ahoy!* This will start your journey into managing
your aquarium.

Format: `tank add d/<TANK_NAME>`

Parameters:
* Prefix parameters:
  * `d/<TANK_NAME>` - [Description prefix.](#description-ddescription) Specifies the name of the tank
    * `<TANK_NAME>` is alphanumeric and can contain spaces. It is case-sensitive

> :exclamation: Warning: You cannot add tanks with the same description to *Fish Ahoy!*

Example:
* `tank add d/Freshwater tank` adds a new tank with the following details:
  * Description: Freshwater tank

### Deleting a tank: `tank delete`

You can delete a tank entry from *Fish Ahoy!* with the `tank delete` command.

Use this command to remove tanks from the system, when you are retiring a tank.

Format: `tank delete <TANK_INDEX>`

Parameters:
* Index parameters:
  * `<TANK_INDEX>` - The tank [index.](#index-parameters) Specifies which tank to delete.
    * `<TANK_INDEX>` is a positive integer (1, 2, 3...) and must correspond to an actual tank.
    
    
> :exclamation: Warning: You can't delete a tank that has fishes and tasks attached to it. Remove those first before deleting the tank. This is to ensure that you don't accidentally remove any fish you did not mean to.


Example:
* `tank delete 2` deletes the second tank in the [tanks panel](#about-the-interface)

### Editing a tank: `tank edit`

You can edit the details of an existing tank with the `tank edit` command.

Use this command if you want to update the original sample tank names to match your tank names, or if you decide that you want to rename
an existing tank.

Format: `tank edit <TANK_INDEX> d/<DESCRIPTION>`

Parameters:
* Index parameters:
  * `<TANK_INDEX>` - The tank [index.](#index-parameters) Specifies which tank to delete.
    * `<TANK_INDEX>` is a positive integer (1, 2, 3...) and must correspond to an actual tank.
* Prefix parameters:
  * `d/<TANK_NAME>` - [Description prefix.](#description-ddescription) Specifies the name of the tank
    * `<TANK_NAME>` is alphanumeric and can contain spaces. It is case-sensitive

> :exclamation: Warning: For `edit` command actions, you must change **at least one** field! In this case, you must include
> a new tank description when you want to use `tank edit`.

Example:
* `tank edit 2 d/My new tank` changes the name of the second tank in the [tanks panel](#about-the-interface) to 'My new tank'.

### Feeding a tank: `tank feed`

You can feed all the fish in a tank, updating all the fishes' last fed date to the current date and time with the `tank feed` command.

Use this command when you feed your fishes in real life, so you can keep track of when you last fed your fishes in *Fish Ahoy!* 

Format: `tank feed <TANK_INDEX>`

Parameters:
* Index parameters:
  * `<TANK_INDEX>` - The tank [index.](#index-parameters) Specifies which tank to delete.
    * `<TANK_INDEX>` is a positive integer (1, 2, 3...) and must correspond to an actual tank.

> :bulb: Tip: If you do not want to set the fishes' last fed date to the current date and time, you can manually update it with the
> `fish edit <FISH_INDEX> lfd/<LAST_FED_DATE>` command!

> :bulb: Tip: If you have any [feeding reminders](#feeding-reminders), the `tank feed` command will automatically remove those for the specified tank!

Example:
* It is currently the 6th of April, 2.31 pm. If you have a tank which index is 1, with 3 fishes, named 'Nemo', 'Dory' and 'Marlin'. `tank feed 1` sets the following details of all three fishes:
  * Last fed date: 06/04/2023 14:31

> the rest of the fishes and tasks belonging to other tanks again!

> :exclamation: Warning: Tasks that do not have a tank attached will not be shown when you view a tank! To see them
> again, use `list tasks`

Example:
* You have 2 tanks, 'Freshwater tank' with index 1 and 'Saltwater tank' with index 2. 'Freshwater tank' has a fish named 'Guppy' with a task named 'clean tank'.
'Saltwater tank' has a fish named 'Clown fish' and a task named 'change thermometer'. `tank view 1` lists the following information in the respective panels:
  * Tanks panel: tanks - 'Freshwater tank' and 'Saltwater tank'
  * Fish panel: fishes - 'Guppy'
  * Task panel: tasks - 'clean tank'

### Sorting fishes: `fish sort`

You can sort the fishes in *Fish Ahoy!* by a specified parameter with the `fish sort` command.

Use this command to view the fish at once by the attribute you want. This can be helpful if you need to see which fish
has not been fed in a long time, or see which fish you need to attend to first. It can also be used to organize the
results to your liking.

Format: `fish sort by/<PREFIX_PARAMETER> [tk/<TANK_INDEX>]`

Parameters:

> :information_source: Additional information: Note that `fish sort` only sorts the fishes that are present in the fish panel!
> <br> For example, `fish view` would result in only 1 fish in the fish panel, and `fish sort` after will not show more fish. You can use `list fishes` before
> using `fish sort` instead.

> :information_source: Additional information: The tank prefix is enclosed in square brackets `[tk/<TANK_INDEX>]` because it is optional,

> :bulb: Tip: Subsequent fishes added will be given an index according to previous `fish sort` commands!

> :exclamation: Warning: If you have feeding intervals with hours greater than 23, `fish sort by/fi` may not work
> as you thought it would! A fish with feeding interval `0d26h` will appear before one with `1d0h`!

Example:
* There are 3 fishes, 'Nemo', 'Dory' and 'Marlin' in the tank with index 1. There is a fish named 'Crush' in the tank with index 2.
Using `fish sort by/n tk/1` will result in the following fishes from tank 1 being displayed in the fish panel in the order:
  * 1 - 'Dory'
  * 2 - 'Marlin'
