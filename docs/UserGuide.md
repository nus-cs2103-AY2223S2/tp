   <br>e.g. typing `help` and pressing the `ENTER/RETURN` key will open the help window.
   <br>Some example commands you can try:
   1. `select 1` : Selects the first course displayed (eg. `CS2103T`) on the `Course Page`. You will be redirected to the `Group Page`.
   2. `select 1` : Selects the first group displayed (eg. `T15`) on the `Group Page`. You will be redirected to the `Student Page`.
   3. `add student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com sid/A1234567X` : Adds a student named `John Doe` with the particulars into the list on the `Student Page`.
   4. `delete student 3` : Deletes the third student (eg. "Lim Kim Choo") shown in the student list.
   5. `undo` : Returns to the state before the previous `delete student` command you entered. The deleted student (eg. "Lim Kim Choo") should be back on the list.
   6. `exit` : Exits the app.
3. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for a detailed description for each command.

### Visuals

Before diving in, it might be useful to take a moment to understand some of CLIpboard's visual elements. It will make it an even more of a breeze to use CLIpboard effectively!

<img src="./images/VisualGuide.png" max-width="80%" max-height="80%"/>
<br>

**1. Toolbar**
   * To close the app, you can simply click on `File > Exit`.
   * To open the help window, click on `Help > Help`.

**2. Page Tabs**
   * The `Page Tabs` give you a quick summary of the type of page you are on.
   * Refer to the [Navigation Guide](#navigation) below to find out more about the different pages in CLIpboard.

**3. Navigation Bar**
   * You can view your selected items in the `Navigation Bar`.

**4. Left Pane**
   * This is where you will see your lists of `Courses`, `Groups`, `Students`, `Sessions`, and `Tasks`.

**5. Right Pane**
   * The `Right Pane` will appear when you are on the `Attendance Page` or `Task Page`. It will show your list of students so you can mark their attendance or assign them a grade.

**6. Command Box**
   * Type your commands here!

**7. Result Display**
   * After entering a command, you can view it's status and feedback in the `Result Display`.
   * If your command fails, you will also find help messages here.

**8. Status Bar Footer**
   * The `Status Bar Footer` displays the file path of the data file used by CLIpboard to store or load your information.

**9. CLIppy Indicator**
   * The `CLIppy Indicator` helps you know whether you have entered a valid command.
     If the command is valid, CLIppy will be happy. Otherwise, CLIppy will be sad.

### Navigation

Navigating between pages is made effortless with CLIpboard's intuitive navigation commands.
Simply choose from a selection of `select`, `back`, `session`, or `task` commands.

Here's a handy navigation map to get around CLIpboard.

<img src="./images/navigationguide.png" max-width="80%" max-height="80%"/>
<br>

Here's a hypothetical workflow that might help you better understand the figure above:<br>
*Say you wish to assign the grades for a task in one of your tutorial groups.*

1. You'll first start on the `Course Page`.
2. Enter the command `select 1` to select the *first* course in the course list. You'll then be brought to the `Group Page` to view the groups of your selected course.
3. You see now that the group you wish to select is the *second* group in the list, so you enter the command `task 2`, and you'll be brought to the `Task Page` of your selected group. Here, you can choose from the tasks that are available, and subsequently enter the grades for your individual students.

*Now, you wish to work on something else, like marking the attendance for another group.*
4. From where we left off, simply enter the command `back` and you'll be brought back to the `Group Page`.
5. From here, you can use `session 4` to view the `Session Page` of the fourth group, and you can then mark their attendance for your selected session.

### Commands

Features in CLIpboard are supported by commands.
Commands are like giving instructions to CLIpboard on what to do.

A typical command would look like this:
<br>
<img src="./images/typicalcommand.png" max-width="35%" max-height="35%"/>

**Command keyword(s)**: Typically 1 or 2 words, they specify the type of action for CLIpboard to execute.<br>
**Supplementary command information**: These provide additional context about a command you wish to execute. Conventionally, these are referred to as "arguments" or "parameters".

Putting it all together for the above example, `find course` would tell CLIpboard that you're looking for a course, and "cs2101" tells CLIpboard which specific course you're looking for.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** <br>

* If a command expects a parameter to be input only once, but multiple instances of it are included, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  * e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not expect any parameters will be ignored.<br>
  * e.g. if you input the command `help 123`, CLIpboard will interpret it simply as `help`.

</div>

#### Understanding Command Formats
To help you understand how CLIpboard recognises commands, these are some of the conventions used in this guide when specifying command formats.

- **Supplementary command information**: These are represented in uppercase and enclosed by angle brackets (`<>`).<br>
  - e.g. in `add course <COURSE>`, `<COURSE>` is a parameter. `<COURSE>` can be replaced with a course code to form the command `add course CS2103T`.
- **Square brackets (`[]`)**: Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  - e.g If the parameters are specified as `[n/<NAME>] [p/<PHONE_NUMBER>]`, omitting these parameters are acceptable.
- **Elipses (`…`)**: Parameters postfixed by `…` can have multiple inputs.<br>
  - e.g. `mark <INDEX>…` can be used as `mark 1` or `mark 1,2,3` etc.
- **Index**: CLIpboard displays items like courses and groups as numbered lists. The *index* of an item in the list might be required as a parameter for some commands.
  - e.g. if the specified command format is `delete course <INDEX>`, and you enter `delete course 3`, CLIpboard will delete the *third* course in the course list.
- **Multiple Parameters**: Some commands require multiple parameters. In such cases, each parameter would require a specific corresponding prefix to denote the type of information it is.
  - e.g When adding a student, there may be multiple pieces of information tied to a student.
    Thus, a typical command for adding a student might look like `add student n/john doe p/12345678`.
    In this command,
    - The prefix `n/` in `n/john doe` tells CLIpboard that this parameter is the student's name.
    - The prefix `p/` in `p/12345678` tells CLIpboard that this parameter is the student's phone number.
- **Parameters can be input in any order**<br>
  - If the command format specifies the required parameters as `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, an alternative format like `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
  :information_source: **Note:** It is important to enter commands exactly in their required formats in order for CLIpboard to understand them.<br>
</div>
