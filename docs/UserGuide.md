# Introduction

Streamline your patient management with lightning-fast efficiency using HospiSearch

HospiSearch is a **desktop app for managing hospital/clinic patients' particulars, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. HospiSearch can also help you complete your patient management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps, regardless of your typing speed.

Our target audience is hospital and clinical administrative staff who deal with the management of large physical patient records and seek a more efficient and streamlined solution. Our app provides them with the ability to add, edit, delete, filter patient records and so much more.

## About this Guide

The purpose of this user guide document is to provide staff with a clear understanding of the features and benefits of HospiSearch. The guide aims to assist users in effectively utilizing HospiSearch's features to streamline their patient management tasks and improve overall efficiency.

## Features

### Notes:

- Input words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.


- Commands in square brackets are optional. e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.


- Commands separated by `|` within `()` suggest that only one of the commands must be present to be valid.


- Items with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times, including zero. e.g., [t/TAG] â€¦â€‹ can be used
  (i.e. 0 or more times), t/friend t/family etc.


- Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** All commands from this point onwards are to be
executed in lower case. E.g., `find` is valid, but `FIND` or `FinD` is considered as invalid. Keywords following commands do
not need to be in lower case.
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a patient record: `add`

Let's say a patient is visiting your clinic for the first time! Use the `add` command to add the patient records to the record list.

Format: `add i/NRIC n/NAME dob/DATE OF BIRTH p/PHONE a/ADDRESS d/DRUGALLERGIES g/GENDER ad/DOCTOR [e/EMAIL] [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹ [m/MEDICINE]â€¦â€‹`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Do take note which patient fields are
optional.
</div>

ðŸ’¡**Tip**:
<br/>The drug allergies field is required however if the patient you are registering does not have any drug allergies, type in NKDA(No Known Drug Allergies)
<br/>A patient can have any number of tags and medicine (including 0).
<br/>A patient can leave out the email prefix should they not want to share it.

Examples:

* `add i/T0012345A n/John Doe dob/20/12/2000 p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/NKDA g/male ad/Alex t/Diabetic m/Lantus`
* `add i/T0012345B n/Betsy Crowe dob/18/12/1998 p/1234567 a/Newgate Prison d/Panadol g/female ad/Shannon e/betsycrowe@example.com t/Dyslexic`

<img src="images/command_result/Add.png" alt="Add" width="63%">

Above is the execution result of the input `add i/S1234567H n/Cedric Pei dob/03/04/2002 p/84655284 a/PGPR g/male d/NKDA ad/Shannon t/Diabetic m/Lantus m/Soliqua`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a patient record: `edit`

Let's say a patient has moved to a different address or undergone significant changes in their medical history. Use the `edit` command to edit their personal particulars.

Format: `edit INDEX [i/NRIC] [n/NAME] [dob/DATE OF BIRTH] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/DRUGALLERGIES] [g/GENDER] [ad/DOCTOR] [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹ [m/MEDICINE]â€¦â€‹`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only include the prefixes for the specific
patient field you would like to edit.
</div>

ðŸ’¡**Tip**:
<br/>You can remove all the patientâ€™s tags/medicine by typing t/ or m/ respectively, without specifying any tags/medicine after it.

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edit the phone number and email address of the patient at index 1 to be 91234567 and johndoe@example.com respectively.

<img src="images/command_result/Edit.png" alt="Edit" width="80%">

Above is the execution result of the input `edit 7 i/G0000000A`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing a patient detailed particulars: `view`

To reduce clutter, we have placed the more in-depth information of a patient in the view panel to the right of the patient list.
Use the `view` command to view these additional details of a patient.

Format : `view i/NRIC`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** For other commands, the view pane will show the particulars of the first patient in our system by default.
But after ADD or EDIT command, the view pane will show the corresponding patient's particulars.
</div>

Examples:
* `view i/G0000000A` shows detailed information about the patient on the view pane.

![View](images/command_result/View.png)

Above is the execution result of the input `view i/S1234567H`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

ðŸ’¡**Tip**:
Double-clicking on a patient achieves the same result!

### Deleting a patient record: `delete`

Let's say you have found an unintended duplicate in the patient records. You can delete this erroneous data using the `delete` command.

Format: `delete i/NRICâ€¦â€‹`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If multiple deletes are made in a single
command, `undo` command will not undo all deletes made, but only **one** at a time.
</div>

Examples:

* `delete i/S1234567A` deletes the patient with NRIC S1234567A from patient records system.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Filtering patients by attribute: `find`

Let's say you want to filter for specific patients quickly during a busy shift. You can use the `find` command to search for patients
based on their name, age, medical condition, or any other relevant criteria.

Command Prefixes that can be searched:

* name(`n/`)
* nric(`i/`)
* tag(`t/`)
* doctor(`ad/`)
* medicine(`m/`)

Format: `find (n/NAME | i/NRIC | t/TAG | ad/DOCTOR | m/MEDICINE ) [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** `find` searches by **complete strings** and not **substrings**. The search will only be carried out for
**one** given attribute.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** The search is **case-insensitive**. The order of the keywords does not matter.
</div>


Examples (The following results are based of the sample data provided):

* `find n/john` returns `John Lim` and `John Doe` who both contain the name `John` in their names.
* `find n/yu bernice` returns `Bernice Yu` as the order of keywords does not matter
* `find i/S0078957G` returns `Alice Tan` who has an NRIC of `S0078957G`.
* `find t/Diabetic Osteoporotic` returns all persons with the tag `Diabetic` or `Osteoporotic` or both.
* `find ad/Shannon` returns all persons with attending doctor `Shannon`.

<img src="images/command_result/Find.png" alt="Find" width="51%">

Above is the execution result of the input `find ad/Alex`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing all patients: `list`

You can use this feature to get a list of all patients in the records.

Format: `list`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** List returns the entire current database

</div>

ðŸ’¡**Tip**:
<br/>After filtering for specific patients, you can view all patients by using the `list` command.

![List](images/command_result/List.png)

Above is the execution result of the input `list`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Backing up patient records: `backup`

Let's say you want to safekeep your current data for future reference. You can use the `backup` command to save the patient records to a specified slot represented by an index and add a description for the backup.

Format: `backup INDEX_NO [b/DESCRIPTION]`


ðŸ’¡**Tip**:
<br/>Backing up without a description will leave the description field empty.

Format: `backup INDEX_NO [b/DESCRIPTION]`


Examples:


* `backup 3 b/Test` backups the data to the 3rd slot with description 'Test'.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**: INDEX_NO can only be an integer between 1 and 10
</div>

<img src="images/command_result/Backup.png" alt="Backup" width="80%">

Above is the execution result of the input `backup 1`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Loading data: `load`

In the event of a data loss, you can load the backup data from a specified slot represented by an index.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Allows access to a specific backup.
</div>

Format: `load INDEX_NO`

Example:

* `load 3` loads the data from the 3rd slot.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing backup data: `viewbackups`
