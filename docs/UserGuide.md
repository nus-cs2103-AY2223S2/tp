## Overview
The following subsections detail the functionality of ***RIZZ***ipe and explain the various terminology and colour coding we will be using in this guide.

### What is ***RIZZ***ipe?

***RIZZ***ipe is a **command-based recipe database** that operates primarily on commands and behaves like a Command Line Interface (CLI).

***RIZZ***ipe comes equipped with numerous features, but we particularly love these **three**:
1. Versatile **tagging** and powerful **search** function
2. Recipe **sharing**
3. **Ingredient substitution** searching

Give ***RIZZ***ipe a try and utilise its many features to achieve your **culinary rizz** today!

## Quick Start

Let's get you _rizzed_ up in the fastest way possible!

1. Ensure you have [`Java 11`](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/) or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest `rizzipe.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases)
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for ***RIZZ***ipe.
4. Open a [command terminal](#glossary), [`cd`](#glossary) into the folder you put the jar file in, and input the `java -jar
   rizzipe.jar` command to run the application.
5. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note that our experienced chefs have already crafted
   some sample recipes for you!<br/><br/>
   ![UI QuickStart](images/UiQuickStart.png)<br/><br/>
6. Navigate through the main window easily using just your keyboard! Toggle between recipes simply by using
   the <kbd>↑ Up</kbd> and <kbd>↓ Down</kbd>  arrow keys!
7. Type commands within the [command line interface (CLI)](#glossary) and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. For a list of executable commands, refer to the [Commands](#commands) Section.
8. Some of the previously mentioned executable commands may have keyboard shortcuts to make your life easier! Refer to each command within
   the [Commands](#commands) Section, or take a look at the [Keyboard Shortcuts summary](#keyboard-shortcuts-summary) to learn more about how to use them!

## Commands
***RIZZ***ipe is a command-driven application, which means its various features and functionalities can be accessed by executing various commands.

### How to interpret the command format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* The first word is the type of command you are running.<br>
  i.e. for the input `delete 5`, we are running the `delete` command.

* We use [prefixes](#what-is-a-recipe) such as `n/` to label our arguments for the command. 

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  i.e. in `add n/RECIPE_NAME`, `RECIPE_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Grilled Salmon`.

* Parameters in square brackets `[]` refer to optional parameters that can be omitted.
  i.e. `n/RECIPE_NAME [d/RECIPE_DURATION]` can be used as `n/Cheese Sandwich d/10 minutes` or `n/Cheese Sandwich`.

* Parameters with `...` behind them can be used multiple times, including 0.
  i.e. `[t/TAGS]...` can be used as `<nothing>` (zero times), `t/HALAL`, `t/HALAL t/BREAKFAST` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order
  i.e. if a command specifies `n/RECIPE_NAME d/RECIPE_DURATION`, then `d/RECIPE_DURATION n/RECIPE_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Excess parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div> 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip**:<br>

For better readability, we have included an optional multi-line command format for commands
that may require multiple inputs (add, edit). After each input,
you can include a line break by simply entering a backslash <kbd>\</kbd> to move on to the next line to continue
writing the next part of your command input! Note that you will not have to delete the backslash that appears
before continuing to type!

</div>

### Attributes

#### What is a recipe?
Recipes are the building blocks of ***RIZZ***ipe! Each recipe consists of multiple attributes, which are listed in the [recipe attributes table](#recipe-attributes-table).<br>

Pay close attention to these attributes, for they are crucial inputs to some of our commands mentioned below!

#### Recipe attributes table

### Adding a recipe: `add`

Come up with a new innovative recipe and afraid that you'll forget about it in the future,
or just want to share it with your friends? Simply run the `add` command, and follow the prompts to save different
information about your recipe such as ingredients and steps!

Format: `add n/RECIPE_NAME [d/RECIPE_DURATION] [p/RECIPE_PORTION] [t/RECIPE_TAGS]... [i/-n INGREDIENT_NAME [-a INGREDIENT_AMOUNT] [-e ESTIMATED AMOUNT] [-cn COMMON NAME] [-r REMARKS]... [-s SUBSTITUTION]...]... [s/RECIPE_STEPS]...`

Example(s) of usage:
* `add n/Honey Chicken Rice`<br/><br/>
![AddCommandUI](images/AddCommandUI.png)<br/><br/>
* `add n/Chicken Noodles d/20 minutes p/1-2 people i/-n chicken thigh -a 300 g i/-n noodles i/-n soy sauce -a 2 tablespoons -s salt`
* `add n/Peanut Butter Sandwich t/breakfast s/Prepare bread and spread s/Using a knife, spread 2-3 scoops of peanut
butter s/Serve and enjoy.`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* A recipe can have any number of steps, tags and ingredients (including 0)!

* It is only compulsory to include the **recipe name** when you first add the recipe into recipe book!

* Although optional, we do however suggest adding in the other fields if possible for your own future reference.

* If you have multiple inputs for tags, steps or ingredients, treat each input as a separate field (i.e. `s/Step1 s/step2`).

* Similar to parameters, ingredient fields do not have to be input in order (`-a` can come before `-n` etc.).

* However, for steps, please input the steps in the order that they are intended to be performed.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip**:<br>

When adding an ingredient, it is only compulsory to include the **ingredient name**. However, you can also add in additional details such as amount (**RECOMMENDED**) and substitutions etc.!

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a recipe through form: `addf`
Want to add a delicious new recipe but don't want to type the whole long string of inputs at one go? 
Use our interactive form feature to add your favorite recipe to the recipe book today!

Format: 
`addf`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* An empty pop-up form as shown in the image below will appear!

![AddCommandWindow](images/addfCommand.png)

* Tab to move on to the next input field, and shift+tab to go to the previous field!

* A new row automatically pops up when you reach the last row for ingredients and steps. Once you're done just click to the next field!

* Note that multiple tags can be added with commas separators. (e.g. `Vegetarian, Halal`)
 
* Click on Save to add your recipe to the recipe book!

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing all recipes: `list`

Ever forget how many recipes you have in your storage? Want to view 'em all? Or
simply want to pick a recipe at random? Just run the `list` command!

Format:
`list`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* Lists all recipes that are in the storage, in the chronological order they were added.

* Depending on the size of the window, the user may add multiple columns to display more recipes.

* In order to zoom in on a particular recipe in the list, user can double-click on the corresponding recipe.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip**:<br>

The `list` command can be used to reset the most recently searched list to the full recipe list after performing a `find` command!

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:computer: **Keyboard Shortcut**:<br>

To navigate the list, you can use the <kbd>↑ Up</kbd> and <kbd>↓ Down</kbd> arrow keys (as previously mentioned in the QuickStart).
While the recipe you want to zoom in on is selected, simply press <kbd>P</kbd> to view that particular recipe's details! 

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a recipe: `edit`

Made a mistake or just omitted some important details when you first stored your recipe in the recipe book? 
Don't fret, for the `edit` command is here for you to supplement these new details to increase the _rizz_ on your recipes!

Format: 
`edit INDEX [n/RECIPE_NAME] [d/RECIPE_DURATION] [p/RECIPE_PORTION] [t/RECIPE_TAGS]...  [i/-n INGREDIENT_NAME [-a INGREDIENT_AMOUNT] [-e ESTIMATED AMOUNT] [-cn COMMON NAME] [-r REMARKS]... [-s SUBSTITUTION]...]... [s/RECIPE_STEPS]...`  

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* Edits the recipe at the specified index. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed recipe list. 
 
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1,2,3,...

* All existing values will be updated to the new input values!
 
* When editing tags, ingredients and steps, all the existing values for these fields will be removed (i.e. adding of tags, ingredients and steps is not cumulative!)
 
* You can remove the optional fields (all fields except for name) by simply typing the prefix without specifying any details after it (i.e. typing `i/` removes all ingredients)
 
</div>


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tips**:

* Alternatively, you can use the edit popup form to edit recipes (see below).
 
* Note that the tags specified in the fields above still apply for ingredients, like `-n`.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:computer: **Keyboard shortcut**:<br>

As an alternative to typing the full command, we provide a popup form to edit a recipe!
While the recipe you want to edit is being selected, simply press <kbd>F</kbd> to display the popup form for that particular recipe!

<!-- have to do this nonsense bc markdown wouldnt render the whitespace properly -->
<img style="margin-top:20px" src="images/EditForm.png" width="1100"/>  

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding a recipe by name: `find`

Have a certain recipe at the back of your mind that you want to refer to?
Or want to look up all recipes associated with a specific tag or those containing a specific ingredient that you're desperate to clear but have no idea what to pair it with?

`find` helps to save your time scrolling through your whole list of recipes by displaying
only those that match any of your specified keywords straight away!

Format:
`find [PROPERTY] KEYWORD [ADDITIONAL KEYWORDS]...`<br>
Supported properties: `name`, `tag` and `ingredient`

i.e. `find name KEYWORD [ADDITIONAL KEYWORDS]...`, `find tag KEYWORD [ADDITIONAL KEYWORDS]...`, `find ingredient KEYWORD [ADDITIONAL KEYWORDS]...`

Example(s) of usage:
* `find cheese` returns all recipes with the keyword `cheese` in their recipe name
* `find name pancakes sandwich` returns all recipes with the keyword `pancakes` and/or `sandwich` in their names

![FindCommandUI](images/FindCommandUI.png)

* `find tag western` returns all recipes with the tag `western`
* `find ingredient tofu` returns all recipes with the ingredient `tofu`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* Adding a property behind `find` is optional, and if no property is specified, `find` defaults to filtering by `name`.

* All keyword queries are case-insensitive. e.g. `chicken` will match `Chicken`

* Recipes matching at least one keyword will be returned, e.g. searching `sandwich fries` will match recipes named `cheese fries` and `ham sandwich`

* Recipes are listed in the chronological order that they were added.

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `ham sandwich` will match a recipe named `sandwich ham`

* Only complete words will be matched. e.g. `chick` will **not** match `chicken`

</div>

### Deleting a recipe: `delete`

No longer like a certain recipe? Simply `delete` it from the database by its index!

Format:
`delete INDEX`

Example(s) of usage:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd item stored in the recipe book.
*  `find chicken`, followed by `delete 1` will delete the 1st recipe in the displayed results of the find command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* Deletes the dish at the specified `INDEX` of the current list that is displayed.

* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:computer: **Keyboard shortcut**:<br>
While the recipe you want to delete is selected, simply press the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or 
<kbd>Backspace</kbd> key and click on confirm to delete that particular recipe!

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Searching for substitutions for an ingredient: `sub`

Short of a particular condiment or ingredient to complete your favourite recipe? Have no fear, for the `sub` command
provides you with a hassle-free way to solve your problem by suggesting some common substitutions so that you can complete your
dish with an alternative ingredient!

Format:
`sub INGREDIENT_NAME`

Example(s) of usage:
* `sub chicken` returns a list of suggested substitutions for the ingredient `chicken`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* `sub` searches across your stored recipes and a preloaded suggested substitutions list to provide you with the most accurate and extensive list of substitutions!

* The search is case-insensitive, i.e. `sub salt` will return all stored substitutions for `Salt` and `salt` across recipes.

* Only full words will be matched i.e. `sub chick` will **not** return stored substitutes for `chicken`

* For inputs with multiple words, it will only match stored ingredients with the same full multi-word input (case-insensitive) i.e. `sub golden syrup` does not return substitutes for `syrup`

* The returned list of ingredients returned will not contain any duplicates.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip**:<br>

Adding a substitution together with an ingredient is recommended since it will boost the number of substitutions listed when that ingredient is queried in the future!

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Asking for assistance: `help`

Unsure or unable to remember our list of commands and how to format your inputs? Fret not, as simply inputting
`help` will save you from your woes!

Format:
`help`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

*  `help` links to this user guide, which is a quick way to refresh your memory on any command that might have slipped your mind!<br/><br/>
![HelpCommandUI](images/HelpCommandUI.png)

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Clearing the recipe book: `clear`

Want to change things up and start a new recipe book afresh? Simply run the `clear` command to wipe the memory
and start afresh!

Format:
`clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Running `clear` will clear your entire recipe book and there's no going back!
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip**:<br>

If you wish to save your data elsewhere first and then start afresh, consider using the [Export](#export) feature first!
</div>

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Done with cooking for the day?
Running `exit` exits the program and closes the window!

Format:
`exit`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip**:<br>

Wondering if you have to save your data before exiting? Don't worry, **RIZZ**ipe automatically saves your data whenever a 
command is executed, so any changes to your recipes will be saved immediately!

## Managing the Data

### Saving the data

Recipe data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

Recipe data is saved as a [JSON file](#glossary) in the following directory:

```sh
(Location where your Recipe Book JAR File `rizzipe.jar` is)
├── data
│   └── recipebook.json <== Your saved recipe JSON file
├── preferences.json
└── rizzipe.jar
```

For advanced users, you can change the default location which the recipebook data file is saved to. This can be done by creating a `preferences.json` file in the base directory where the app is stored, and specifying `userPrefsFilePath` in `preferences.json` with the desired file path.

### Editing the data file

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file located at the address above. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file result in an invalid format, ***RIZZ***ipe will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Importing data

Pressing <kbd>F3</kbd> will open an import window from the main window (as shown in the image below). From there, select the JSON
file to be imported using the selector.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Additional information**:

* Only files with recipes that pass our formatting checks, and files with no duplicate recipes will be imported
* Any imported recipes will be added to your current recipe book!
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip**:<br>

Alternatively, you can access the import function from the <kbd>File</kbd> tab in the top left corner of the main window.

### Exporting data

The keyboard input <kbd>F4</kbd> will open an export window from the main window (as shown in the image below). From there, input the file name of the
JSON file to be exported and select the desired location for it to be saved!

![ExportDataWindow](images/ExportWindow.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

Alternatively, like the import function, you can access the export function via the <kbd>File</kbd> tab in the top left corner of the main window.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Export the current recipe book with our `Export` function and send the JSON file to the other computer. On the other computer, run ***RIZZ***ipe and use the `Import` function to import all previously saved recipe files!
