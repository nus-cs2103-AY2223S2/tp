</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> **:information_source: Finding your java version**: To check the default java version on your device, run `java -version` on your terminal. You should see a line of text with `11.x.x`. For more information, refer to [this guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html#cmdline).
</div>

<br>

2. Download the latest `medimeet.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MediMeet.

4. Open the `medimeet.jar` file by double clicking on it. (On Windows, if a dialog box opens asking 'How do you want to open this file?', choose 'Java(TM) Platform SE binary'.) A window similar to the picture below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
    * If you are familiar with terminals and command lines, you can choose to open the file from a command line instead. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar medimeet.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
    * As you can see from the screenshot of the application, we have four primary parts in the UI. They are:
      * **Command box**: This is where the user types in their commands.
      * **Patient list**: This is the currently shown list of patients with the numbers representing patient index numbers.
      * **Appointment list**: This is the currently shown list of appointments with the numbers representing appointment index numbers.
      * **Calendar**: Shows a calendar view of the current month. When a date is clicked, it will show a popup detailing the appointments for that day.

5. Maximise the app for the best user experience with viewing appointments. If the app is not maximised, some parts of the application may not be shown on your screen.

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list_patient` : Lists all patients.
   * `add_patient n/Brenda Song p/98765432 e/brendas@example.com a/Red Road, Blk 123, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `Brenda Song` to MediMeet.
   * `delete_patient 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.
   * `add_appt n/Brenda Song ts/04032023 10:00,04032023 11:00 d/Regular checkup doc/Xiao Lu` : adds an appointment on `March 4, 2023` from `10:00` to `11:00` hrs for `Brenda Song` with doctor `Xiao Lu` for a `Regular checkup`.
   * `delete_appt 1` deletes the 1st appointment shown in the current list.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

In this section, you will get to learn about the various features of MediMeet.
Before you dive into the features, we would like to give you some pointers about the command format.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: **Tip:**
Many of the longer commands in MediMeet have a shorter alias. For example, `add_patient` can be used as `ap` instead. Where applicable, the alias will be shown next to the command.
</div>

### Adding a patient: `add_patient` or `ap`

Adds a patient to MediMeet.

Format: `add_patient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
MediMeet does not support phone numbers longer than 15 digits. Although MediMeet will still accept phone numbers longer than 15 digits, the application might display the patient list strangely.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Tags should be limited to 30 characters or less. If you want to record information longer than that, use the `remark` command instead.
</div>

Examples:
* `add_patient n/Brenda Song p/98765432 e/brendas@example.com a/Red Road, Blk 123, #01-01`
