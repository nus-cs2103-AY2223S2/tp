will reside in.
4. Double-click on the jar file to launch HMHero.
5. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

<img src="images/ui.png" alt="UI image" width="500" height="400">


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong> <br>
Ensure that the file is added to an empty folder as additional data and configuration files will be created when HMHero
is launched for the first time in your computer!
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong> <br>

## Quick Start
This section covers everything you should know about HMHero, as well as a tutorial on 
[trying your first command](#trying-your-first-command). Take note that  the
[Key Definitions](#key-definitions) and [Command Format](#command-format) sections covers essential knowledge to using HMHero's features.


### User Interface
When you launch HMHero, HMHero appears on your screen as a Graphical User Interface(GUI). Let's explore the
layout of the different components of HMHero.

HMHero's GUI consists of a single main window consisting of 3 main sections.
1. [Command Input Box](#command-input-box): Input command text field
2. [Command Output Box](#command-output-box): Command result
3. [Applicant List Box](#applicant-list-box): List of applicants 

The following picture of the main window shows the three components, numbered accordingly:
![components.png](images%2Fcomponents.png)

HMHero also has the Help Window. It is not part of the main GUI and is only
shown after a [Help Command](#receive-help-during-usage-help) is run.

The Help Window looks like the following:

![help_window.png](images%2Fhelp_window.png)

### Key Definitions

#### Applicant

An applicant in HMHero represents an individual that applied for a job at your company. HMHero tracks various
attributes of an applicant. Compulsory attributes would include their name, phone number, address and email.

The following are the attributes stored for each `Applicant`
* Name
* Phone Number
* Address
* Email
* Application Date
* Interview Date
* Notes

Applicants are unique by name and phone number and are case sensitive.
This means you cannot add two or more applicants of the same name and phone number.



[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Notes

A note in HMHero serves as a means of labelling the skills of an applicant. These tags
are unique and case-sensitive.

We can tag multiple applicants with the same note and each applicant can have multiple notes. These notes
are optional.

Feel free to make use of notes as you fit to highlight skill-sets of an applicant. Examples of such notes
can include:

  * Technical proficiency, e.g. `Python`, `Java`, `Flask`
  * Soft Skills, e.g. `Project Management`, `Event Planning`

HMHero's Notes are unique by name and are case-sensitive. This means you cannot add two or more notes of
the same name.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Flags
Flags are delimiters that enable HMHero to distinguish different parameters without ambiguity.

You could put in the corresponding [Placeholder](#placeholders) immediately after each flag.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong> <br>
You may find the following image taken from the subsequent <a href="#command-format"> Command Format </a> section helpful:

Placeholder refers to the UPPER_CASE words that can be replaced by valid user input supplied.
These placeholders follow immediately after a [Flag](#flags).

These placeholders follow immediately after a [Flag](#flags).

Please refer to the subsequent [Command Format](#command-format) 
section to see how Flags and Placeholders are used together.

### Command Format
Before you delve into the different commands in Commands, let’s learn what a command consists of.

Here is an example:
![CommandExample.png](images%2FCommandExample.png)
A command consists of:
Command Word: Tells HMHero what action you wish to execute. These actions are covered in [Commands](#commands).
<br>
[Flags](#flags): Distinguishes between inputs. A flag is usually followed by a placeholder.<br>
[Placeholders](#placeholders): Represents data that you wish to input. Replace this with valid data.<br>
For example, `NAME` in `n/NAME` can be replaced with `n/John`.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Trying your First Command

To let you become more familiar with HMHero, let's practise executing some commands.

One of the available commands in HMHero is the command to create a new applicant.

**Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [applied/APPLIED DATE TIME] [note/NOTE]`
<br>
<br>

**What does the format mean?**
* `add` tells HMHero that this is the command to create a new applicant
* [Flags](#flags) such as `n/` and `p/` are delimiters that enable HMHero to distinguish different
parameters supplied by you without ambiguity
* [Placeholders](#placeholders) such as `NAME` and `PHONE` shows you what you should place in each portion of the 
command

Notice that there is a pair of square brackets `[]` surrounding some parameters like `note/NOTE` and `applied/APPLICATION DATE TIME`
in the format. This indicates that the parameter is **optional**. Each of these placeholders in the parameters 
have a default value based on the commands. These are documented in the [Commands](#commands) section for each command.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">:information_source: <strong>Info:</strong> <br>
The <a href="#placeholders">Placeholder</a> section covers the restrictions for respective placeholders. For example, 
for the format of Phone, only numeric characters can be used and there is a mimimal length of at least 3 numbers to be provided. 
</div>

**Let's try an example!**

Suppose you just add Thomas, 98765432, thomas@gmail.com, living at 1 Sims Drive (s)543210, and you do not
feel the need to record a note for this applicant.

`NAME`: Thomas

`PHONE`: 98765432

`EMAIL`: thomas@gmail.com

`ADDRESS`: 1 Sims Drive (s)543210

The command you would like to enter into the command box would be:

```
add n/Thomas p/91918153 e/thomas@gmail.com a/6 Sims Drive (s)543230
```

Find out more about restrictions in the sections [Flags](#flags), [Placeholders](#placeholders) 
and [Commands](#commands). 

---

Here are some pointers to look out for before running a command:

* I know the restrictions of the command
* I know what parameters are supplied to the command
* I know the flags for each parameter to be supplied
* I know the restrictions of each parameter
* I know the effects of not specifying each optional flag.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:**

The JAR file not launching even after double-clicking the file.

**Solution:**

1. Open your terminal
* Windows:
    * The default key combination to launch your terminal is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
* Mac:
    * Use <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open Spotlight Search
    * Search for "terminal" and click it to launch. 
2. Navigate to the location where "hmhero.jar" is stored within your terminal using `cd`. For example, `cd Downloads/`


3. On your terminal, run `java -jar hmhero.jar`

**Problem:**

The JAR file not launching in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">:information_source: **Info:** 
WSL does not support GUI applications by default. 
</div>

**Solution:**

1. Our recommendation is to run HMHero application on Windows and not on WSL.

**Problem:**

Unable to exit/save HMHero to data file

**Solution:**

1. This error is due to `hmhero.jar` being started in a protected folder. (Examples of write-protected folders include`C:\WINDOWS\System32` in windows and the `/etc` dir in linux) <br> Please move the `hmhero.jar` file into another folder in your computer and start HMHero application from that folder.
