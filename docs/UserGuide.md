## Command Syntax

First-time users may have difficulty understanding the syntax described in the command instructions.

If you are new to using a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, we recommend reading this brief section before using FastTrack.
Understanding the **CLI** will help you enter commands more efficiently, which can save you time in the long run.

In simple terms, the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a way to interact with FastTrack by typing in commands using just one line of text. This means you can add expenses quickly and easily.

Here is a quick guide on how to read the syntax mentioned in the User Guide for using FastTrack's commands.

```
command tag1/ PARAMETER_1 tag2/ PARAMETER_2 [tag3/ PARAMETER_3]
```

| Element     | Format                                        | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `command`   | Name of command <br/> eg. `add`, `find`       | Specifies the command to be executed.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `tag/`      | Prefix for a field, followed by `/`           | Specifies which field given input argument is for                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `PARAMETER` | Words that are in UPPERCASE                   | Specifies user input for field specified by `tag/` <br/><br/>e.g.<br/>In `add c/CATEGORY_NAME`, `CATEGORY_NAME` is a parameter, which the user decides is “groceries”. The final command will be entered as add `c/groceries`. |
| `[]`        | Square brackets around `tag/` and `PARAMETER` | Indicates that field specified by `tag/` is optional and may be omitted. <br/><br/>If left unspecified, it will be set to a default value.                                                                                     |

For example, the command format for `add`:

```
add c/CATEGORY_NAME n/ITEM_NAME p/PRICE [d/DATE]
```

- `add` is the `command` name.
- `c/`, `n/`, `p/`, `d/` are `tag/`s to denote fields of _category_, _name_, _price_ and _date_ respectively.
- `CATEGORY_NAME`, `ITEM_NAME`, `PRICE`, `DATE` are `PARAMETERS` to be supplied to the aforementioned `tag/`s.
- `[d/DATE]` indicates that the field for the date is optional.

Don't worry if it takes a bit of time to get used to the commands. Once you're familiar with the commands, you'll be able to add expenses quickly and easily.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Information about the command format**<br>

Before diving further into the guide, here are some things to take note about the way we formatted commands for FastTrack in this user guide.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `c/CATEGORY_NAME p/PRICE`, `p/PRICE c/CATEGORY_NAME` is also acceptable.

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/4.50 p/5.80`, only `p/5.80` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:warning: Warning about Date Formatting:** <br>
Some commands may include the entry of a `DATE`, like the `add` command or the `addrec` command. A specific date format, `Day/Month/Year` should be used to format the date provided.

However, if the day is **within 1-31** but **not a valid date**, _e.g. 30th February_, FastTrack will smartly correct your date provided to the last date of the month. <br>i.e, `30/2/2023` will be corrected to `28/2/2023`.

# **Category Features**

FastTrack makes it easy for you to keep track of your spending by organizing expenses into categories. A category is like a folder that holds all your expenses that fall under a specific theme. For example, you might have a category called Groceries where you record all purchases from Fairprice or NTUC.

To create a category in FastTrack, simply give it a name, such as Entertainment or Transportation. You can also add a short text summary to give yourself more context about the category.

FastTrack even has a default Misc category for any expenses that you haven't categorized yet, however, this category is not modifiable or accessible.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Info**<br>
Note that category names in FastTrack are case-insensitive. For example, a category named `Groceries` will be treated as the exact same category as `groceries`.

</div>

Format: `addcat c/CATEGORY_NAME s/SUMMARY`

| Parameter       | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `CATEGORY_NAME` | Title of the category to be added.                  |
| `SUMMARY`       | Short summary of what this category keeps track of. |

### Examples

![FastTrack addcat](images/demo/category/addcat.png)

## **Deleting a category** `delcat`

Deletes the category at the specified `INDEX` in the category list.

Format: `delcat INDEX`

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If you delete a category that has existing expenses associated with it, those expenses will be automatically reassigned to the default internal `Misc` category. But don't worry! You can still re-assign them later with the [edit expense command](#editing-an-expense-edexp). To avoid losing track of expenses, we recommend that you review and update your categories periodically, rather than deleting them altogether.

# **Expense Features**

An **expense** is a single purchase that you want to track. Each expense has a _name_, _price_, _category_, and _date_. With FastTrack, you can easily duplicate an expense if you happen to make the same purchase multiple times, such as buying a coffee from CoolSpot every morning on your way to NUS.

Finally, there are **recurring expenses**. These are expenses that are charged on a regular basis, such as a monthly subscription to Netflix or an annual Heroku subscription. Instead of manually creating an expense every time the payment is due, you can set up a recurring expense in FastTrack.
Simply specify the start date, interval (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), and end date (if applicable), and FastTrack will automatically generate the expenses for you.

## **One-Time Expenses**

---

## **Listing expenses** `list`

The `list` feature in FastTrack allows you to view all your expenses. You can filter the list based on specific categories and timeframes to get a more customized view of your spending.

If you apply the `CATEGORY_NAME` filter, only expenses associated with that particular category will be displayed. For instance, if you filter by `groceries`, you'll only see the expenses you've categorized as `groceries`.

If you apply the `TIMEFRAME` filter, you can see expenses that fall within a particular time period. For example, you could filter by `month` to see only the expenses you incurred in the current month.

If you don't specify any filters, the expense list will show all your expenses by default.

Format: `list [c/CATEGORY_NAME] [t/TIMEFRAME] [r/RECUR_PERIOD]`

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CATEGORY_NAME` | The name of the category of which expenses are classed under.<br/><br/>This parameter is optional.                                                                                                          |
| `TIMEFRAME`     | The timeframe of which expenses were added. <br/><br/>The timeframes available are:<br/>1. `week` (alias: `w`) <br/>2. `month` (alias: `m`)<br/>3. `year` (alias: `y`)<br/><br/>This parameter is optional. |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: What is a timeframe?**<br>

A `TIMEFRAME` allows you to set a specific interval to filter your expenses. `t/w` or `t/week` is a timeframe representing the current week, while `t/m` or `t/month` is a timeframe representing the current month, and `t/y` or `t/year` is a timeframe representing the current year.

</div>

### Examples

- `list`
- `list c/Groceries t/week`
- `list c/Entertainment t/month`
- `list c/Food`
- `list t/w`
- `list c/Entertainment t/year`

### Demonstration

### **List Expenses by Category**

1. Enter the command `list c/drink` into the command box

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Using both `CATEGORY_NAME` and `TIMEFRAME` filters:**<br>

- Using both the category and timeframe filters will only display expenses that satisfy both the filter conditions.<br>
e.g. in `list c/food t/week`, only expenses with both the category name "Food" and date falling within the current week will be displayed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Info**<br>

Note that once a recurring expense is added, it automatically adds a series of expenses to the expense list at the specified interval until the `END_DATE`. If an `END_DATE` is not yet specified, the expenses will be added up to the current date.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Tip:

FastTrack's recurring expense feature is designed to help you keep track of regular expenses that occur at a fixed interval, such as monthly subscription fees or cloud storage bills.
By setting up a recurring expense, you save precious time and effort by automating the process of adding these expenses to FastTrack.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution**<br>

Avoid setting an `END_DATE` that is too far in the future or a `START_DATE` that is too far in the past. Setting a date range that spans a large number of years or generates a large number of expenses may cause FastTrack to become temporarily unresponsive.
For example, if the current date is `3/2/2023` and the `START_DATE` is set to `3/2/2000` with an `INTERVAL` of `day`, this will generate over 8,000 expenses and may cause performance issues.

</div>

### Examples

- `addrec n/milk c/groceries p/4.50 sd/20/3/2023 t/month`
- `addrec n/milk c/groceries p/4.50 sd/20/3/2023 ed/15/5/2023 t/w`

### Demonstration

1. Enter the command `addrec n/milk c/groceries p/4.50 sd/20/1/2023 t/week` to create a weekly recurring expense starting on 20/1/2023.
2. FastTrack creates the new recurring expense with the confirmation message `New recurring expense added: Recurring Expense: milk, Amount: 4.5, Category: groceries, Start Date: 2023-01-20, End Date: Ongoing, Recurring Expense Type: WEEKLY`

![FastTrack addrec1](images/demo/recurring_expense/addrec1.png)

3. Enter the command `list` to switch to the **Expense Display**. Notice that FastTrack has automatically added the weekly expenses in the expense list!

![FastTrack addrec2](images/demo/recurring_expense/addrec2.png)

## **Deleting a recurring expense** `delrec`

Deletes an expense category at the specified `INDEX` in the recurring expense list.

Format: `delrec INDEX`

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `INDEX`   | The index number shown in the displayed recurring expense list.<br/><br/>It must be a positive integer i.e. 1, 2, 3, ... |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Automatic Deletion of Recurring Expenses:

If a recurring expense's end date has already passed, FastTrack automatically deletes the recurring expense the next time the application is started. This means you do not need to worry about manually deleting recurring expenses which are no longer applicable!

</div>

### Examples

- `lrec` followed by `delrec 2` deletes the second recurring expense in the recurring expense list
- `lrec` followed by `delrec 1` deletes the first recurring expense in the recurring expense list

### Demonstration

1. Enter the command `lrec` to switch to the **Recurring Expense Display**
2. Enter the command `delrec 2`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution**<br>

If you want to stop a recurring expense before its intended `END_DATE`, make sure to delete it before the current date. 
If you edit the recurring expense to end before the current date, this only prevents new expenses from being added, but expenses that were previously generated will still exist in FastTrack.

</div>

### Examples

- `edrec 1 c/groceries t/week` updates the category and recurrence period first recurring expense in the expense tracker.
- `edrec 2 p/4.50 ed/15/5/2023` updates the price and ending date of the second recurring expense in the expense tracker.

### Demonstration

1. Enter the command `lrec` to switch to the **Recurring Expense Display**.
2. Say you have upgraded to a Netflix yearly subscription plan - enter the command `edrec 2 p/200 t/year` .
3. FastTrack edits the second recurring expense in the recurring expense list with the confirmation message `Edited recurring expense generator: Recurring Expense: Netflix, Amount: 200.0, Category: entertainment, Start Date: 2023-01-20, End Date: Ongoing, Recurring Expense Type: YEARLY`.

## **Setting A Budget** `set`


Sets a monthly budget for FastTrack. For first-time users of FastTrack, no budget is set and expense statistics are not updated. 


In order to view all the expense statistics, you must first set a budget using this command.

FastTrack derives the weekly budget from this monthly budget by dividing the monthly budget by 4.

Format `set p/AMOUNT`

| Parameter | Description                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AMOUNT`  | The monthly budget amount to set. The specified budget should be a number, e.g. 4, 4.50. |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution**<br>

FastTrack does not allow setting a budget of $0.

</div>

### Examples

* `set p/500` sets the monthly budget of FastTrack to $500.

### Demonstration

## **Category Autocompletion**

FastTrack offers a powerful and time-saving feature that autocompletes your category names for you! When you start typing `c/`, FastTrack provides a list of suggested category names as a popup above the command box.
Give it a try and see how much time you can save with this feature!

### How to Use Category Autocompletion?

- Type `c/` in the command box to trigger the autocompletion feature.
- FastTrack will display a list of suggested category names above the command box.
- To select a category name from the list, use the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to navigate through the suggestions list.
- Press `ENTER` to autocomplete the selected category name.
- If the category you're looking for is conveniently at the bottom of the list, simply press `TAB` to autocomplete the first suggested category without having to navigate through the list manually!
- If you decide not to use any of the suggested categories, just continue typing your own category name as per normal.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Tip:

Want to use `TAB` directly without navigating inside the suggestion list?
Narrow down the list of suggested categories by typing the first few words of your desired category name. Once the option appears at the bottom of the list, simply press `TAB` for autocompletion.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
**:exclamation: Caution**<br>


To use category autocompletion, make sure that `c/` is the last text you've entered into the command box. 
If there is any other text in front of `c/`, the autocompletion feature will be disabled. 


</div>

### Demonstration


1. Enter `list c/` into the command box.
2. A list of suggested categories appear in a popup above the command box.
3. Navigate into the suggestion list using the `UP` arrow key and press `ENTER` on the desired category `Transportation`. 
4. This autocompletes the category name.
5. If you need to navigate out of the suggestion list, press the `DOWN` arrow key until the cursor returns to the command box.


![FastTrack autocomplete_a1](images/demo/general/autocomplete_a1.png)
![FastTrack autocomplete_a2](images/demo/general/autocomplete_a2.png)

3. If the desired category `Shopping` is the first suggestion in the list (the bottom-most suggestion), press `TAB` within the command box.
4. This autocompletes the category name.

Exercise caution before using this command.

</div>

2. FastTrack clears all previously logged expenses, recurring expenses and categories, with the confirmation message `Deleted all prior entries`.

Format: `exit`

## **Viewing help** `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page, as well as a quick rundown of what commands can be used.

# Expense Statistics Feature

FastTrack provides you with real-time statistics on your spending to help you keep track of your monthly budget.
Here are the types of statistics displayed and what they mean.

![FastTrack expense_statistic](images/demo/general/summary.png)

## Monthly spending statistic

This statistic represents the **total amount of money you have spent** in the **current month**. 
It includes all expenses recorded in the current month. 


For example, if the current month is March, this statistic shows the total amount of money spent in March.

## Monthly remaining statistic

This statistic represents the **amount of money you have left** from your **monthly** budget.
It gives you an idea of how much money you have left to spend for the rest of the month.

## Monthly percentage change statistic


This statistic represents the percentage **increase** or **decrease** in your **monthly** spending relative to the previous month. 
The indicator colour is **red** if it is a percentage increase and **green** if it is a percentage decrease.


For example, if you spent $500 last month and $750 this month, the monthly percentage change indicator would be `+50.00%` and be displayed in a red colour.
If you spent $750 last month and $500 this month, the monthly percentage change would be `-33.30%` and be displayed in a green color.

## Weekly spending statistic


This statistic represents the **total amount of money you have spent** in the **current week**, starting from Monday to Sunday. 
This gives you an idea of how much money you are spending on a weekly basis.

## Weekly remaining statistic

This statistic represents the **amount of money you have left** from your **weekly** budget. 
Your weekly budget is the value of your monthly budget divided by four. This gives you an idea of how much money you have left to spend for the rest of the week.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**


Please take note that this value should be treated as a rough guide. <br>
Even if you have exceeded your previous week's budget, this statistic will show that you have more remaining, as the weekly budget is fixed based on the monthly budget. 

Therefore, it is important to use this value as an estimate and not solely rely on it for your spending decisions!

</div>

## Weekly percentage change statistic

This statistic represents the percentage **increase** or **decrease** in your **weekly** spending relative to the previous week.
The indicator colour is **red** if it is a percentage increase and **green** if it is a percentage decrease.

For example, if you spent $500 last week and $750 this week, the weekly percentage change indicator would be `+50.00%` and be displayed in a red colour.
If you spent $750 last week and $500 this week, the weekly percentage change would be `-33.30%`.

## Total spent statistic

This statistic represents the **total amount of money you have spent to date**, starting from the first expense you recorded in FastTrack. 

This gives you an idea of how much money you have spent over the period of time from when you started tracking your expenses.

## Budget utilisation percentage statistic

This statistic represents the percentage of your monthly budget that you have already utilised in the current month.

For example, if your monthly budget is $1000, and you have already spent $500, your budget utilised percentage would be `50%`.
This gives you an idea of how much of your monthly budget you have used up.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution**<br>

Even if you have exceeded your budget, this statistic will reflect that you have fully utilised your budget, and will remain at `100%`.
