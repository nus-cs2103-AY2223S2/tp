MyLib is a **desktop app for managing bookmarks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MyLib can get your bookmark management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `myLib.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Library.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar myLib.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all Bookmarks.

   * `add n/The Odyssey a/Homer p/Reading g/Epic poetry t/Literature class readings` : Adds a bookmark for the book `The Odessey` to the Library.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd Bookmark shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all Bookmarks.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/TITLE`, `TITLE` or name of `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/The Odessey`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TITLE [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/The Odessey t/School` or as `n/The Odessey`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/School`, `t/School t/Recreational` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/TITLE a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR n/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `a/John Butcher a/Jim Butcher`, only `a/Jim Butcher` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
