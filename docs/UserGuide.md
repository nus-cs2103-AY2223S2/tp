<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (Even not at all).<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is specified multiple times when it is only expected once, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* For commands that require index, the index is based on the current person/group list shown.

info following the latest attribute (in the example case, WGT will take event name to be test 2). 

* The format of both `START_DATETIME` and `END_DATETIME` would be in `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`
* `START_DATETIME` has to be before the `END_DATETIME`
* `START_DATETIME` and `END_DATETIME` has to be after the current date and time

Examples:
* `event_create 1 ie/CS2101 Presentation f/02/02/2025 16:00 t/28/02/2025 18:00`

#### 2) Weekly Recurring Event `event_create_recur`

2) Type the command `free` followed by the group index. In this case, the group index is 2.
3) Hit enter.

![Free time](images/FreeTime2.png)
1) The free time slots will be generated and shown below.
2) The free time slots are shown from the current day that the command is entered.
3) However, if you would like to change the start date, you can indicate the `START_DATE` but it is optional.

## Data-related commands
### Importing data : `import`
Import one person into your address book to update their details and events.

Format: `import`

* Stored data must be in a file called `export.json` and the file must be placed in the folder `data` which is in the same location as the JAR file.
* Stored data can only contain 1 person.
* The imported person will not have any tags or groups.
    * This is because groups and tags are dependent on how the user wants to assign them. Therefore, merging or overwriting groups/tags when importing is not appropriate.
* If the imported person is already an entry in your address book with the same name (case-sensitive), their phone number, address, email as well as their event lists will be updated to the imported data.
* If the imported person is not yet an entry in your address book, a new entry will be created with the imported person's details (excluding tags and groups).

### Export a person: `export`
Export a person's details from the address book.

Format: `export [PERSON_INDEX]`

* Exports a person's details with the specified `INDEX`
* All details except groups and tags are exported (Reason mentioned in `Import` section)
* Export data is saved in the data/export.json
* Exporting a person will overwrite any existing export.json file

Examples:
* `export 1`
* `export 2`

### Saving the data

WhereGotTime data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

WhereGotTime data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/wheregottime.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, the app will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous WhereGotTime home folder.
