## About TeachMeSenpai

## Guide on using Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Notes about the command format:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
  _(eg. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`)_

- Items in square brackets are optional.  
  _(eg. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`)_

- Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.  
  _(eg. `[t/TAG]...` can be excluded completely, or once `t/friend`, or twice `t/friend t/family`, etc.)_

- Parameters can be in any order.  
  _(eg. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable)_

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.  
  _(eg. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken)_

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `redo`, `undo`, `show`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.  
  _(eg. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`)_

</div>

---

### Find/filter students: `find`/`filter`

Finds entries of students based on a keyword in the field that you want. <br>

The `find` and `filter` command allows you to match keywords or partial keywords with the entries, for example:<br><br>
`find Sh` displays the students with names which contain `sh` in them, such as `Shaun` or `Amresh`.<br><br>
This applies to all fields EXCEPT tags and modules, where you will have to enter and find them by the 
tags and modules in full. <br><br>
the `find` command allows you to hone in on an entry that matches **all** your `FIELD` and `KEYWORDS`
, but `filter` will also show you those who match with **at least one** of the criteria.

> Format: <br>
> `find FIELD... KEYWORDS...` <br>
> `filter FIELD... KEYWORDS...`
* `FIELD` refers to the type of details such as name, address, email and so on.
* Input the field like so:
  * Name: `n/`
  * Address: `a/`
  * Email: `e/`
  * Phone No.: `p/`
  * Education: `edu/`
  * Telegram Handle: `tele`
  * Remark: `r/`
  * Tags: `t/`
  * Modules: `m/`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">


</div>

Examples:

- `find Sh` will display the students named "Shao Hong" & "Shaun"
- `find a/pas` will display students who stay at places which names that contain `pas` such as `Pasir Ris`
- `filter t/URGENT` will display students who have the exact tag `URGENT`
- `filter m/CS2101` will display students who have the exact module `CS2101`

**Using the following input fields `find n/a m/CS2103T`:**
<p align=center>
    <img alt="find before" src="images/user-guide/find_before.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> Before entering <code>find</code> command</i>
</p>

<p align=center>
    <img alt="find after" src="images/user-guide/find_after.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> After entering <code>find</code> command</i>
</p>

:bulb: **Note:** Here find shows only `Alex Yeoh` as his entry matches all criteria.
<p align=center>
    <img alt="filter before" src="images/user-guide/filter_before.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> Before entering <code>filter</code> command</i>
</p>

<p align=center>
    <img alt="filter after" src="images/user-guide/filter_after.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> After entering <code>filter</code> command</i>
</p>

:bulb: **Note:** Here, other entries that match some criteria like `Roy Balakrishnan`
are shown too.

[↑ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

---

### Delete a student: `delete`

Deletes the specified student from the address book.

> Format: `delete INDEX`

- Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
- The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

- `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in the address book.

<p align=center>
    <img alt="delete before" src="images/user-guide/delete_before.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> Before entering <code>delete</code> command</i>
</p>

<p align=center>
    <img alt="delete after" src="images/user-guide/delete_after.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> After entering <code>delete</code> command</i>
</p>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Tip:** 
You can combine `find` and `delete` when you have a very long list of students. <br>
For instance, you can `find` the student(s) you want gone, and then `delete` using the index from the list displayed!
</div>

---

### Undo a previous command: `undo`

Did you make a mistake with a command? Don't worry, simply `undo` it!

You can `undo` as many times as required, as long as the previous commmand is **undoable**.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Note:** You can only undo `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `remark`, `clear`, and `redo` commands as these are the only commands 
that change the data of your TeachMeSenpai app!
Trying to `undo` without having ANY of the above commands prior will cause TeachMeSenpai to show you an error message.

</div>

> Format: `undo` 

Example: `delete 1 4` followed by `undo`. <br>

### Redo a previous `undo`: `redo`

Did you `undo` a command on accident? Fret not, you may use `redo` to reverse the changes done by `undo`!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Note:** You can only redo an `undo` command.
Trying to `redo` without ANY prior `undo` command will simply cause TeachMeSenpai to give you an error message.

</div>

>Format: `redo`

Example: `delete 1 4`, followed by `undo`, then `redo`.

[↑ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

---

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Need to clear all your entries? Simply use `clear` to help you delete all your entries at once!

>Format: `clear`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Note:** Don't worry if you cleared all your entries by accident, simply use `undo` to reverse the change! Do note that 
if you exit the app immediately after `clear`, using `undo` upon relaunching the app can't retrieve your data anymore :(
</div>
### Saving the data

TeachMeSenpai data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually 🙂

[↑ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### Editing the data file

**:exclamation: Warning:** If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TeachMeSenpai will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
