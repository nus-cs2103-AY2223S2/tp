# Calidr: User Guide

Welcome!

Calidr is a **time-management and scheduling calendar application** for university students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Calidr helps you manage and store your classes, assignments, deadlines, and tasks from one place.
          
This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the features of Calidr. Whether you're a new user [getting started](#quick-start) with the basics or an experienced user looking for [advanced tips and tricks](#paperclip-features), this guide has everything you need to know.

We recommend that you refer to the [Definitions](#mag-definitions) to familiarize yourself with the terminology used in this guide.

If you have any questions or run into problems, check out the [FAQ](#faq) for solutions to commonly faced issues.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `calidr.jar`, available [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home directory_ for your Calidr.

4. Double-click the `calidr.jar` file.
   A window similar to the one shown below will appear.
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box at the top and press `Enter` to execute it.

   E.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

6. Refer to the [Features](#paperclip-features) below for details of each command.

## :mag: Definitions

### Command definitions

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
🕮 From now on we'll be using a slightly modifided version of the <a href="http://docopt.org/">docopt</a> command description language.
</div>

1. We will use the word "**string**" to describe any general sequence of characters.
2. We will use the word "**word**" to describe a sequence of characters terminated by a whitespace.
3. Words ending with a backslash `/` are interpreted as _compulsory_, _position-independent_ **options**.

   `t/`,`by/`,`from/`,`to/`
4. Uppercase words denote the position of **arguments**.
5. All other words that do not follow the above conventions are interpreted as **commands** and **subcommands**.

   `help`
6. Options can have arguments specified after a whitespace. Together they are refered to as a **field**.

   `todo t/ <title> by/ <date-time>`
7. An option's arguments, when bracketed by "<" and ">", can be **whitespace-containing** strings. They are terminated
   by a newline or a different option, matching *leftmost-first*

   `event t/ <title> from/ <start-date-time> to/ <end-date-time>`
8. Else, if the arguments are in uppercase, they must be **strictly words** terminated by whitespace

   `delete TASK_INDEX`
9. Some commands may accept a single *positional* argument string, known as a **main argument**, beginning after a
   whitespace following the command itself and terminating at a newline or the first option, matching *leftmost-first*.

   `edit TASK_INDEX t/ <title>`
10. Options (and arguments) bracketed with "\[" and  "\]" are **optional**.

    `[d/ <description>] [p/ <priority>]`
11. Ellipsis "..." specify that the argument (or field) to the left could be **repeated** multiple times:

    `[tag/ <tag>]...`
12. *All elements are required by default*, if not included in brackets "\[ \]". However, sometimes it is necessary to
    mark elements as **required** explicitly with parentheses "( )". For example, when you need to group
    mutually-inclusive elements (if *one* element is present, then *another* one is required):

    `edit TASK_INDEX (OPTION <argument>)...`

### Data terminology

1. Elements on a calendar are referred to as **Tasks**.
2. Tasks must have a **title**.
3. A task can have an optional **description**, **location**, and multiple **tags(s)**.
4. Tasks have an associated **priority**.
    1. Priority is one of `HIGH`, `MEDIUM` or `LOW`.
    3. Tasks have a default priority of `MEDIUM`.
5. Tasks must either be **ToDos** or **Events**.
    1. ToDos have a single associated **date-time** (e.g. a due date).
        1. ToDos also have an associated **status**.
            1. Status is one of `DONE` or `NOT DONE`.
            1. ToDos have a default status of `NOT DONE`.
    2. Events have *two* associated date-times (e.g a start and end-date).
6. Dates are specified in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`. Date-times are specified in the format `DD-MM-YYYY HHMM`. Calidr also
   accepts and automatically parser the following keywords as date-times:

   `today`, `tomorrow`, `next week`, `next month`, `next year`
7. Tasks are uniquely identified by their **task index**. This is given in the list panel, and is also used to refer to
   tasks in commands.

### UI terminology

![Ui](images/Ui_annotated.png)

1. **Command box**
   
   The command box is where you can type in commands to Calidr. Pressing `Enter` will execute the
   command.

1. **Calendar panel**
   
   The calendar panel is where you can view your tasks graphically. Tasks are displayed as coloured
blocks, with green being **ToDos** and blue being **Events**. The calendar panel also displays the _focused_ date and
time, which [may not be the current time](#viewing-a-different-date-view).

1. **List panel**
   
   The list panel is where Calidr will display the list of tasks that match your command. This usually
just shows all the tasks in the calendar, but can
be [filtered by title, date, or other criteria](#searching-and-filtering-for-tasks-search).

1. **Result panel**
   
   The result panel is where Calidr will display the result of your command, including any errors.

### Other

#### Saving your data

Calidr user preferences and calendar information is saved in the hard disk automatically after any modification command. The calendar data is stored
as an [ics file](https://www.ical4j.org/).

#### Editing the data file

The `calendar.ics` save file is located in the `data` folder the directory the program resides in (i.e. `[root_directory]/data/calendar.ics`). Advanced
users are welcome to manipulate data directly by editing the save file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
    If your changes to the save file makes its format invalid, Calidr will discard all data and start with an empty data file the next time it's run.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous Calidr home directory.
