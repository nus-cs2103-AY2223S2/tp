PlanEase is a **desktop app tailored for event planners to organise and manage their contacts**. It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the familiar GUI from the address book. If you are a fast typist, PlanEase will accelerate your current workflow compared to your traditional address books.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest [planease.jar](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W16-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to a local folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your PlanEase application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar planease.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `listevent` : Lists all events.

   * `listall` : Lists all contacts and events using a single command.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `addevent ev/CEO's 50th Birthday Carnival from/17-07-2023 12:00 to/23-07-2023 22:00` : Adds an event named `CEO's 50th Birthday Carnival` to the Address Book.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  E.g `n/NAME [evt/EVENT_INDEX]` can be used as `n/John Doe evt/1` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  E.g. `[evt/EVENT_INDEX]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `evt/1`, `evt/1 evt/2` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken. (With the exception to the `evt/EVENT_INDEX` parameter)<br>
  E.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* As a result of the earlier feature, input by the user must not contain command prefix. This is to avoid misrepresentation of the command.<br>
  E.g. `add n/Jane Lee p/62353535 e/janeizbored99@myspace.com a/123 n/Sapporo Shi` would be recognised as adding a contact with name, 'Sapporo Shi' because of `n/`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* All `DATETIME` must strictly be in this format: `DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm`.

</div>
### Contact Features

#### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book and adds existing event tag to this person if event index is specified.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
