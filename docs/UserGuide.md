## Overview

Finding it hard to manage your student contact details and keep track of their progress?

Finding it a hassle to keep a list of student tasks and scores?

**MATHUTORING** helps you solve these problems!

**MATHUTORING**, a centralised desktop application targeted to **private Math tuition teachers**, helps you manage student contact details and performance by keeping student contact details, tasks, and scores.
You can also see score charts and statistics!

What's more, you can generate a PDF report of your student containing the student's tasks and scores.
If you need to switch to a new device, you can also export and import your previous data into the application!

**MATHUTORING** is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, **MATHUTORING** can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `mathutoring.jar`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MATHUTORING app.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar mathutoring.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   <br>
   The initial GUI below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data for your reference, you are free to delete the sample data after you get familiar with the MATHUTORING.<br>

    ![InitialUi](images/UG-images/InitialUi.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students in the student list.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 c/87849999 t/female t/primary` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the student list in MATHUTORING with two tags attached.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd student (if the student exists) shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Recommended minimum screen size: 740x700.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/primary` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/secondary`, `t/secondary4 t/secondary` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but the user specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if the user specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* __Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (including `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear`, and `switch`) will be ignored.<br>__
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Command words are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies such as `help`, `HELP`, `Help`..., it will be interpreted as `help`.

Adds a student to the student list.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS c/CONTACT_PARENT [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tips:**<br>
* A student is allowed to have alphanumeric or numeric names, however, special characters (e.g. `à`, `_`) are not allowed.

* A student can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution:**<br>
* In order to avoid potential confusion, we do not allow any student to have the same name regardless of the letter cases (e.g. Harry, HARRY, harry are deemed as same name).
* If the user wishes to add in a student who has the same name as an existing student in the student list, consider adding a number after the student's name to distinguish them.  e.g. Emily and Emily 2 are acceptable names.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source:  Note about the avatars (profile pictures):**<br>

### Saving the data

* MATHUTORING data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command. There is no need to save manually.
* If the user would like to save the MATHUTORING data in a different location, they can use the [`export`](#1-exporting-the-data-of-the-students-export)
command.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### Editing the data file

MATHUTORING data are saved as a JSON file `<JAR file location>/data/mathutoring.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: Caution:
If the changes to the data file make its format invalid, MATHUTORING will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.

## GUI display restrictions
We have set up a few GUI display restrictions in order to avoid the GUI being affect by extreme inputs (e.g. super long name) or small screen size, and thus hinder the user experience.
* If the student name is more than 29 letters, the full student name will be displayed in the student list. However, the
task list will only display the first 29 letters, with the remaining letters shown as ellipsis.

* If the score label is more than 11 letters, the full score label will be displayed in the score list, text panel.
However, the chart tooltip will only display the first 11 letters, with the remaining letters shown as ellipsis.

* When you try to open external windows (Import, Export, Export Progress, and Help Windows), you might notice that it doesn't open if it is minimized. The proposed solution is in the developer guide.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MATHUTORING home folder.

**Q**: I can't find the `mathutoring.json` file and the files exported for `export` and `exportp`. What should I do? <br>
**A**: Open the application using `java -jar mathutoring.jar` instead of opening the application by clicking the JAR file. More details can be found in the [Quick start](#quick-start) section.
