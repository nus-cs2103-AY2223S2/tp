NextBigFish (NBF) is a
**desktop app tailored for the needs of sales-people, supporting the management of contacts, leads or clients ** 
and optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, NBF can get your client and lead management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
NBF allows client contacts to hold data on their potential business size and counts of past transactions and aids users in categorising them using `tag`s
On top of that, NBF also provides a summary page to allow users to quickly get an overview of their performance each season, detailing relevant statistics.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `nextbigfish.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-4/tp/releases/).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your nextbigfish.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar nextbigfish.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 s/500 c/Bacefook pr/HIGH tr/25 t/friends t/owesMoney` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each available command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

**Notes about the command format**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
