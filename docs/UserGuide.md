--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have [`Java 11`](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `wife.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/releases).

3. Double-click on the application to run WIFE!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
If double-clicking the application does not work:
  * Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your WIFE.
  * Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put `wife.jar` in, and use the following command to run the application.<br>
  `java -jar wife.jar` 
</div>

A _GUI_ similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.
   ![Ui](images/UG/Ui_current.png)
The main application consists of 3 components, namely:
* Food List
* Result Display
* User Input Box

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Trying out your first command!
Not sure how to start? Don't worry, let's start out with a simple command as an example using the sample data
provided in WIFE when you first start up. 

* Type the following command in the user input box at the bottom of WIFE and press the "Enter" button beside it. (You can 
also press "Enter" on your keyboard!)
  
  `add n/Coca Cola u/Cans q/5 e/01-01-2099`

You should see the Food List be updated as such.

  ![Ui_updated](images/UG/AddFood.png)

Congratulations, you just added your first item!

To see what the command format means, you can refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command to maximise your productivity with WIFE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you, the user!<br>
  e.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Meiji Milk`.

  * Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    e.g. `inc INDEX [q/QUANTITY]` can be used as `inc 1 q/10` or as `inc 1`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG NAME]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Vegetables`, `t/Fresh` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME u/UNIT`, `u/UNIT n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only **once** in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. In `tag INDEX n/TAG NAME`, if you specify `tag 1 n/item 1 n/item 2`, only `n/item2` will be tagged to that food item.

* _Extraneous parameters_ for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
</div>
