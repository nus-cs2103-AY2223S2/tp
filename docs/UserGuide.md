## About MedInfo
MedInfo is a simple application that will help you manage your patients' **statuses, wards,
discharge dates**, and ward **occupancies**. <br>
<br>
Considering the time-critical nature of hospital services, patient and ward management are
of utmost priority, where the smallest delays or lapses in updating information can affect
how your hospital attends to your patients. **MedInfo** was designed with this in mind.
It has simplified and optimized patient and ward management, allowing you to in-process, update, and move patients
around while still being able to view overall stats of the hospital at a glance.<br>

## Features

The section below describes the commands available in MedInfo. The commands fall under 3 categories:
- [Patient Features](#patient-features)
- [Ward Features](#ward-features)
- [Utility Features](#utility-features)

Our commands follow a certain format for ease of use. If you are new to MedInfo, do take some time to familiarise
yourself with the command format from the notes below.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add nric/NRIC name/NAME`, `NRIC` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used as `add nric/S1234567A name/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `name/NAME [s/STATUS]` can be used as `name/John Doe s/GREEN` or as `name/John Doe`.

[//]: # 'Might be used in future features'
[//]: # '- Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>'
[//]: # '  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as `` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.'

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME s/STATUS`, `s/STATUS name/NAME` is also acceptable.

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `nric/S1234567X nric/S1234567A`, only `nric/S1234567A` will be taken.

- Commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, and `exit`) will ignore any parameters supplied
  along with it.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

## Patient Features
### Adding a patient to the system: `add`

Adds the patient (NRIC, name and status).

Format: `add nric/NRIC name/NAME [s/STATUS]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The first and last letters in NRIC must be capitalised.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about `add`:**<br>
- The default status is set to `GRAY`.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### Listing all patients in the system: `list`

### Editing a patient’s details in the system: `edit`

Edit an existing patient’s status or ward or discharge date-time.

Format: `edit INDEX [s/STATUS] [w/WARD] [d/DISCHARGE]`

- Edits the patient's details at the specified index as of the currently displayed list.
- The status of a patient is either `GRAY` or `GREEN` or `YELLOW` or `RED`.
- The ward allocated to a patient is represented as an alphanumeric string. E.g `A01`.
- The discharge date-time is of the `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm` format. E.g `12/03/2023 1200` is interpreted as 12th March 2023 1200hrs.

Examples:

- `edit 1 s/GREEN` Edits the status of the first currently displayed patient to be `GREEN`.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### Sorting all patients in the system: `sort`

Sorts all the patients with the specified field and order in the system.

The fields that you can sort by include:
- patient name (`name/`)
- status (`s/`)
- discharge date (`d/`)
- ward name (`w/`)

You can sort in one of two orders:
- ascending (`asc`)
- descending (`desc`)

Format: `sort FIELD/ORDER`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about `sort`:**<br>
- You can only sort by one field in a command.
- When sorting by status (in ascending order), the order is `GRAY`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, then `RED`. The `GRAY` status is given the lowest priority as the patient's condition is unknown, while the `RED` status is given the highest priority due to the patient's critical condition.
</div>

Examples:

- `sort s/asc`

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### Finding patients by name in the system: `find`

Shows a list of all patients with their details that match input name or NRIC.

Format: `find name/NAME`, `find nric/NRIC`, `find s/STATUS`, `find w/WARD`

- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
- Either only the name or only the NRIC is searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

<!-- EXAMPLE OF TIP -->
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Using `find` with a status acts as a filter on that status.
</div>

Examples:

- `find name/John` returns `john` and `John Smith`
- `find name/john carlos` returns `John Smith`, `Carlos Lopez`<br>

## FAQ :raising_hand:

**Q**: I keep forgetting the commands, is there a quick way to get help?<br>

**A**: Yes! Entering the `help` command will show a message explaining how to access the help page.<br>
<br>

**Q**: Why can't I remove the waiting room?<br>

**A**: As every hospital would have some pre-screening room for patients to wait in, and to make it easier
to start entering patients into the system, the waiting room is made un-deletable.<br>
<br>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another device/computer?<br>

**A**: Install the app in the other device/ computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with
the file that contains the data of your previous MedInfo home folder.<br>
