## Welcome to Docedex
{: .no_toc}

***Taking control of hospital administrative management is just a few keystrokes away!***

Docedex is a **desktop application** built for **medical administrative assistants**
to manage doctors and patients within clinics.

Here's an **overview** of how Docedex can help you streamline your hospital management processes.
- Store and edit information about your patients and doctors
- Track the status of your patients and doctors
- Assign patients to doctors upon triaging

On top of these functionalities, we believe that patient management must be **efficient**.
Therefore, Docedex is **optimized for** use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI).**
If you type fast, Docedex can get your hospital management tasks done faster
than current GUI apps in the industry.

**If you are new here**, visit our [quick start](#quick-start) guide to onboard onto Docedex smoothly!

## **Quick start**

1. Make sure that you have **Java 11 or above** installed on your computer.
   - [How do I check my version of Java?](#checking-java-version)
2. Download the latest jar file (`docedex.jar`) from our [Github Releases](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/releases/).
   ![DownloadDocedex](images/DownloadDocedex.png)
3. Move the jar file to a folder where you want to store the data of the doctors and patients.
- Create a new folder called (you can name it Docedex) where you would like to house the application (e.g., Desktop, Documents, etc.).
- Move the downloaded jar file to this folder as shown below.
  - For Mac Users:
    ![DownloadDocedexMac](images/DownloadDocedexMac.png)
  <br><br><br>
  - For Windows Users:
  ![DownloadDocedexWindows](images/DocedexInFileWin.png)
4. Launch Docedex
- For Mac Users:
  - Open a new Terminal window (Command + Space > type Terminal > Enter).
  - Navigate to the folder where you have stored the jar file using the `cd` command.
    - For example, if you have stored the jar file in a folder called Docedex, you can type `cd Docedex` and press Enter.
  - Type `java -jar docedex.jar` and press Enter.

### Notes about the GUI

#### Selecting doctors or patients through commands

Certain commands involve the selection of doctors
and patients immediately after they are entered.

For example, when you type in the `add-doc` command, Docedex will automatically select
the newly added doctor and display their details to you. This gives the user (you!)
a nice visual feedback that the command is successful.

Upon selecting a doctor, the Patient List displays the patients assigned
to the selected doctor. However, if the doctor is newly added, said doctor will have
no patients, and thus the Patient List will be empty.

This behaviour will also exist if the user adds a patient instead too.

#### Unselecting doctors or patients

Unselecting doctors and patients is currently not supported in Docedex. If you wish to
look through all the doctors and patients in Docedex, please use the
[`list-doc`](#listing-all-doctors) and [`list-ptn`](#listing-all-patients) commands instead.

## **Docedex Tutorial (for new users)**

This is a tutorial for **first-time** Docedex users.
1. Launch Docedex. You may refer to the instructions [here](#quick-start)
   - Note: On launch, Docedex will not contain any doctor or patient records.
2. Let us try **adding a doctor** to our Docedex. Enter the command `add-doc n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com s/Cardiology y/5 t/surgeon` in the command box.
   - Note: On adding a new doctor, the patients' list is filtered to show only patients associated with the doctor. To view all patient records, simply type `list-ptn` in the command box.
     ![AddDoc](images/AddDoc.png)
3. Let us try **adding a patient** to our Docedex. Enter the command `add-ptn n/Patrick Bateman p/85167604 e/psigma@gmail.com h/1.88 w/80.5 d/Rhinitis st/Outpatient r/Dust allergy t/pendingReview` in the command box.
   - Note: On adding a new patient, the doctors' list is filtered to show only doctors associated with the patient. To view all doctor records, simply type `list-doc` in the command box.
     ![AddPtn](images/AddPtn.png)
4. Add a few more doctors and patients to Docedex!
5. Let us try **assigning the patient to the doctor**. Enter the command `assign-ptn ptn/1 doc/1` in the command box.
   - Note: On assigning a patient to a doctor, the doctors' list is filtered to show only doctors associated with the patient. To view all doctor records, simply type `list-doc` in the command box.

     ![SelectDoctor](images/SelectDoctor.png)
7. Let us try **selecting the patient**. Enter the command `sp 1` in the command box. This time, the doctors' list is filtered instead.
   - Note: On selecting the patient, the doctors' list is filtered to display only patients associated with the patient. To view all doctors use `list-doc`.

    - Users can edit specific doctors in the clinic by providing at least one of the optional parameters. Specified parameters will be updated to the input values and all other parameter values will remain the same.
    - At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.
    - When editing tags, you have to include any previous tags that was already included in the doctor, or else these tags will be removed. This also means that you can use `t/` to remove all tags from a doctor using the `edit-doc` command.

- Examples:
    - `edit-doc 1 p/91234567` Edits the phone number of the 1st doctor to be `91234567`.

### Loading Data from another computer

**Q**: How can I load data from another computer into Docedex installed on another computer?<br>
**A**: Delete the `docedex.json` file (stored at `[JAR file location]/data/docedex.json`) from the computer that you wish to use Docedex on. Then, copy over the `docedex.json` file from the computer which you no longer wish to use Docedex on. After which, boot up Docedex to check whether your doctor information is properly loaded into the new computer.
