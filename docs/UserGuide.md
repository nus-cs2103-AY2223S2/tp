## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
  <br>
- Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

  <br>

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG …]​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
  <br>

- Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  <br>

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
  <br>

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  <br>

**:construction: Limitations for current iteration:**<br>

- SalesPunch can only accept up to 2147483647 contacts and up to 2147483647 transactions. 
  Therefore, commands referencing INDEX can only reach up to 2147483647.
  <br>

- Commands do not yet take into account an empty contact list.
  Some may still function so long they are valid.
  <br>

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

Format: `help`

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)



### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the contact list.

Format: `add n/NAME g/GENDER p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL c/COMPANY l/LOCATION o/OCCUPATION j/JOBTITLE a/ADDRESS [t/TAG …]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A contact must include all fields except tag and have a unique name that is not already in the contact list.
</div>

Examples:

- `add n/Amelia Oliveiro g/female p/93210283 e/Amelia@example.com c/Mac King l/America o/entrepreneur j/CEO a/Blk 11 Ang Mo Kio Street 74, #11-04`

</div>

- `add n/Bob Builder g/male p/85355255 e/amy@gmail.com c/Tesleh l/Singapore o/engineer j/industrial engineer a/123, Jurong West Ave 6, #08-111 t/friends t/construction t/alumni` Creates contact with multiple tags associated to them

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the contact list.

Note that any transactions tied to the deleted person will not be deleted together. 
This could produce transactions with invalid owner. The user should delete related transactions 
or edit them with `edittxn INDEX to/NEW_OWNER` to assign them to an existing person.

Format: `delete INDEX`

- Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
- The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:

- `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the contact list.
- `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the contact list.

Format: `list`

### Sorting all persons : `sort`

Sorts all persons in the contact list based on an attribute.

Format: `sort ATTRIBUTE`

ATTRIBUTE: `name, gender, phone number, email, company, location, occupation, job title, address, status`

- Only one of the attributes needs to be included.
- The contact list will be sorted based on the specified attribute by their value.

Examples:

- `sort name` Sorts all persons alphabetically by name.
- `sort occupation` Sorts all persons alphabetically by occupation.

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the contact list.

Note that the lead status of the person is not available for editing here. Modifying the lead status
should be done via the `status` command.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [g/GENDER] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [c/COMPANY] [l/LOCATION] [o/OCCUPATION] [j/JOBTITLE] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG] …​`

- Edits the person at the specified required `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- Existing values will be updated to the input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
- You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
- `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Contacts can have multiple optional tags associated with them.
</div>

- `edit 1 t/friends t/alumni` Edits the name of the 1st person to have the following tags `friends` and `alumni`

### Assigning lead status: `status`

Assigns the lead status of a contact. At the same time, saves the timestamp of when the lead status has changed. The
user can use this information as a gauge of how long a client has stayed in a certain status.

Format: `status INDEX s/STATUS`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If the lead status specified is the same as the previous, nothing is changed and the timestamp is not refreshed. This is
to mitigate the chances of accidental reassignment of the same lead status by the user.
</div>

The 4 types of lead statuses supported are:

| Type        | Formats (Case-sensitive) | Meaning                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UNCONTACTED | `Uncontacted` or `U`     | The user has not gotten in touch with (contacted) the saved person. By default, newly added contacts have this status                                        |
| WORKING     | `Working` or `W`         | The person has been contacted. The user is currently nurturing a relationship with the contact with the hopes of making them a qualified lead.               |
| QUALIFIED   | `Qualified` or `Q`       | The contact is a client that has been nurtured to a ready, buying customer. A contact that has a prospect to buy or is in the sales funnel should go here.   |
| UNQUALIFIED | `Unqualified` or `X`     | This status should only be used when it is certain that the customer's intents are not a match for the user's sales, and have no prospects of buying at all. |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
There might be other types of lead statuses definitions (<a href="https://www.varicent.com/blog/6-essential-salesforce-lead-status-options-that-align-sales-and-marketing">examples</a>)
that you might want to use. For this application, we have implemented only 4 types of lead statuses for simplicity's sake.
</div>


Examples:  
`status 1 s/Q` Assigns the status of QUALIFIED to ID `1` in the current list of persons.  
`status 2 s/Working` Assigns the status of WORKING to ID `2` in the current list of persons.
