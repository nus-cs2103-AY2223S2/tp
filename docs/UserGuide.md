## Getting to know LoyaltyLift

This section is designed to help new users get started with using LoyaltyLift.
In this section, you will learn how to perform essential tasks such as adding customers, creating orders, and setting up rewards. 
By the end of these tutorials, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamental features of LoyaltyLift and how to use them effectively to improve your business operations.

So, let's dive in and get started!


### Navigating around LoyaltyLift

Before starting your journey with LoyaltyLift, let's take a quick look at the layout of LoyaltyLift.

![Layout of LoyaltyLift](images/loyaltyLiftLayout.png)

It comprises 3 panels, the *Information Panel*, *Command Panel* and *List Panel*. 
The *List Panel* displays either **customers** or **orders**, controlled by *List Tabs*.
  
The components are summarised below.

|         Component | Purpose                                                            |
|------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Command Panel | Input area to submit your command to LoyaltyLift                   |
| Information Panel | Displays details of a specific customer or order                   |
|        List Panel | Displays list of customers or orders                               |
|         List Tabs | Switch between displaying customers and orders in the *List Panel* |

#### Using the Command Panel
{: .no_toc}

The *Command Panel* is where you type and submit your commands.
LoyaltyLift then processes your request and performs them if it is successful.

If LoyaltyLift understands your request, it will perform it and display feedback that it has succeeded, as seen below.

![CLI Success](images/cliSuccess.png)

Otherwise, the input font will turn red instead, as seen below. 
The feedback will assist you in correcting the command as much as possible. 

![CLI Failure](images/cliFailure.png)


Now that you are familiar with the layout of LoyaltyLift, you are ready to jump right into using the application!

### Add your first customer and order

In this tutorial, you will learn how to add your first customer _Lyndon Edwards_ and his order of 2 of his favourite _Banana Cake_.
Finally, you will learn to remove a customer and observe that **all orders belonging to a customer will be removed as well**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If you have not done so, use the `clear` command to remove the sample data!
</div>

#### Your first customer, Lyndon Edwards
{: .no_toc}

Adding your first customer is effortless on LoyaltyLift using [`addc`](#adding-a-customer--addc). 
Enter the following command to insert a new customer _Lyndon Edwards_ along with some basic contact information.

    addc n/Lyndon Edwards p/93015612 e/lyndon@example.com a/Loyalty Street 103, block 122, #01-20

The application should already have your customer displayed by this step.
Nonetheless, you can always type the following commands to list all customers and view the first customer in LoyaltyLift, corresponding to _Lyndon Edwards_.

    listc
    viewc 1

![result after adding customer](images/addingFirstCustomerResult.png)

#### Your first order, 2 x Banana Cakes
{: .no_toc}

Now that _Lyndon Edwards_ is in LoyaltyLift, we can add an order for him.
This can be done with the [`addo`](#adding-an-order--addo) command like the following.

    addo 1 n/Banana Cake q/2 

Likewise, the application should already have the order opened for your convenience. 
To do this manually, you can list all your orders and view the first order's information by performing the following commands.  

    listo
    viewo 1

![result after adding customer and order](images/addingFirstCustomerOrderResult.png)

#### Clear application data again
{: .no_toc}

Before ending this tutorial, let us clear our application data by removing _Lyndon Edwards_ and his _Banana Cake_ order.

While the [`clear`](#clearing-all-entries--clear) command achieves this quickly, we can also simply remove _Lyndon Edwards_ from LoyaltyLift with the [`deletec`](#deleting-a-customer--deletec) command.

    deletec 1

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
In addition to removing `Lyndon Edwards` from the application, all of his orders are also removed!
</div>

Hence, you will notice that the order list is now empty, and our application is back to a clean slate.

    listo

![result after deleting lyndon edwards](images/addingFirstCustomerOrderClearResult.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Following your order to completion

By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to update your order's status in LoyaltyLift, which will help you to better understand and manage the process of orders in your own business.

#### The order's status
{: .no_toc}

In LoyaltyLift, an order can have the following status.
* Pending
* Paid
* Shipped
* Completed
* Cancelled

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the order status:**<br>

LoyaltyLift assumes that your order will follow a process similar to the order of status stated above (excluding 'cancelled').
</div>

Before we start, head over to [_Add your first customer and order_](#add-your-first-customer-and-order) to include _Lyndon Edwards_ and the _Banana Cake_ order.
However, do not clear the application data as we will be using the order for this tutorial.

#### Advancing an order's status
{: .no_toc}

Let's take a look at our current list of orders, which should only consist of the order of _Banana Cake_.

    listo

Notice that the order's status is now 'Pending'.
To advance an order's status, the [`advo`](#advancing-an-order-status-advo) command will come in handy, which takes the order index as its only parameter.

    advo 1

![result after advancing order status](images/advanceOrderResult.png)

Now, the status of the order should be 'Paid'. Doing this multiple times will eventually update the order's status to 'Completed'.
Further attempts to advance the order status will return an error!

#### Reverting an order's status
{: .no_toc}

To revert an order's status, the [`revo`](#reverting-an-order-status-revo) command is similar to [`advo`](#advancing-an-order-status-advo) but has the inverse effect. 

    revo 1

Now, the status of the order should be 'Pending'. 
As expected, trying to revert the status when it is already 'Pending', will be met with an error!

#### Cancelling an order
{: .no_toc}

An order can be cancelled at any stage of the order. This can be performed with the [`cancelo`](#cancel-an-order-cancelo) command.

    cancelo 1

![result after cancelling order](images/cancelOrderResult.png)

Looking at the order status, it is now reflected as 'Cancelled'. Once an order is cancelled, its status can no longer be advanced.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If you accidentally cancel an order, you can still revert its status!
</div>

[ðŸ • Back To Top](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Rewarding your customers

This tutorial will teach you the rewards system in LoyaltyLift and how you can apply it to boost your business's customer loyalty.

#### The Tier System
{: .no_toc}

In LoyaltyLift, there are three tiers with their associated point threshold.

|   Tier | Point Threshold |
|-------:|:----------------|
| Bronze | 1000            |
| Silver | 5000            |
|   Gold | 10000           |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
LoyaltyLift assumes that your tier system will follow a similar style of Bronze, Silver and Gold.

The point threshold above means that if a customer has cumulative points equal to or greater than that threshold, he will be part of that tier.
For instance, a customer with 5500 cumulative points will be in the Silver tier as he is above the Silver tier point threshold
but below the Gold tier point threshold. 

</div>

Before we start, head over to [_Add your first customer and order_](#add-your-first-customer-and-order) to include _Lyndon Edwards_ and the _Banana Cake_ order.
However, do not clear the application data as we will use the customer for this tutorial.

Rewarding your customers with points is an effortless process on LoyaltyLift using 
[`setpoints`](#setting-reward-points-for-a-customer--setpoints) or 
[`addpoints`](#addingsubtracting-points-for-a-customer--addpoints).

In this scenario, we want to add points to _Lyndon Edwards_ for his _Banana Cake_ order!
Here, we assume that _Lyndon Edwards_ is at your first index.

Enter the following command to add points to _Lyndon Edwards_ to reward him points.

    addpoints 1 pt/800

![result after adding points](images/addingPointsResult.png)

You should see that _Lyndon Edwards_ has _800 points_.

Now that _Lyndon Edwards_ has some points, let's claim a reward on his behalf for being a loyal customer.
In this scenario, let's say that it costs _500 points_ for a water bottle. 
Let's use _500 points_ from _Lyndon Edwards_ to reward him with a water bottle!
Using the [`addpoints`](#addingsubtracting-points-for-a-customer--addpoints) command, you can then easily track his new points again.

Enter the following command to subtract points from _Lyndon Edwards_ after claiming a reward for him.

    addpoints 1 pt/-500

![result after subtracting points](images/subtractingPointsResult.png)

You should see that _Lyndon Edwards_ has _300 points_ remaining. However, do note that he still has 800 cumulative points,
as cumulative points are not subtracted away while claiming rewards.

Lastly, perhaps you feel that this was an error. _Lyndon Edwards_ should have _8000 points_ for being such a loyal customer.
You can overwrite his previous points and cumulative points, using the [`setpoints`](#setting-reward-points-for-a-customer--setpoints) command!

    setpoints 1 pt/8000

![result after setting points](images/setPointsResult.png)

You should see that _Lyndon Edwards_ now has _8000 points_ and _8000 cumulative points_.
Also, you should observe that he is now part of the **Silver** tier as he has above 5000 cumulative points!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The difference between `setpoints` and `addpoints` is that setting points will also set cumulative points to the same amount. 
If you wish to keep the current cumulative points, use the `addpoints` command instead.
</div>

You should now be able to reward any of your customers with our point system!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* You should supply parameters to words in `UPPER_CASE`.<br>
  e.g. `addc n/NAME ...`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addc n/John Doe ...`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `...n/NAME [q/QUANTITY]` can be used as `...n/Cake q/2` or as `...n/Cake`.

* Items in curly brackets are an indication to use one of the given options, separated by the character `|`.
  e.g. `ct/{ind|ent}` is a parameter that should be used as `ct/ind` or `ct/ent` exactly.

* You can enter parameters in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Some commands require you to specify an `INDEX`:**<br>

* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹ 

* The index refers to the index number of a customer or order as shown in the **List Panel**.
  * `CINDEX` refers to a customer's index
  * `OINDEX` refers to an order's index

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Setting points will also set cumulative points to the same amount, if you wish to keep the current cumulative points, use the `addpoints` command instead.

With `addpoints`, you can add or subtract points from your customers as they place orders. 
LoyaltyLift keeps track of their cumulated points and assigns them a tier to tell you who are your most loyal customers!

**Format**

```
addpoints CINDEX pt/POINTS
```

* Adds or subtracts the points of the customer at the specified `CINDEX` by `POINTS`.
* If the points subtracted is greater than what the customer has, the command will not be executed.
* If the points added will result in points or cumulative points being greater than 999999, 
the command will not be executed.

## FAQ

### Customers
{: .no_toc}

**Q**: My customer's name includes special characters such as 'JÃ´se'; how can I add this customer into LoyaltyLift? <br />
**A**: Currently, LoyaltyLift cannot store a customerâ€™s name with special characters. However, one workaround is to add the customer by replacing the special character with a close equivalent, such as 'Jose', and use the `setnotec` command to type his actual name, such as `setnotec 1 nt/JÃ´se`.

**Q**: How do I view a customer's order history in LoyaltyLift? <br />
**A**: The order history of a customer is available when you view the customer's information in the information panel. To do so, you can first use `findc` command to locate the customer, then `viewc` command to display the customer in the information panel. The order history is found under the **History** section.

**Q**: How can I store specific requests from my customer's for an order? <br />
**A**: Using the `setnoteo` command, you can add information such as special customer requests for that particular order! Here is an example when your customer requests lesser sugar: `setnoteo 1 nt/less sugar`.

**Q**: The note I have saved for my customer is no longer valid; how do I clear the note for this customer? <br />
**A**: Assuming the customer is at position 1 in your customer list, you can execute the command `setnotec 1 nt/` to clear the current notes for a customer.

### Orders
{: .no_toc}

**Q**: Why are orders deleted or missing after deleting a customer with `deletec`? <br />
**A**: Orders are closely tied to a customer in LoyaltyLift. Once a customer has been removed, all the customer's orders needs to be cleared. If this is not ideal, we recommend avoiding deleting any customers.

**Q**: Can my orders have a different address than the customer's address? <br />
**A**: Yes! When you create an order using `addo`, you can specify the new address with the parameter `a/`. If this is not specified, the customer's address is used instead for your convenience.

**Q**: I have cancelled or completed an order by accident, how do I undo this action? <br />
**A**: With the `revo` command, you can quickly revert the order's last status change you have made with `advo` or `cancelo`!

### Rewards
{: .no_toc}

**Q**: Are the reward tiers of my customers based on the cumulated points or the current points they have? <br />
**A**: Currently, LoyaltyLift determines the tiers of your customers by the **cumulated points**. However, if you feel that a customer no longer deserves the tier, you can use `setpoints` to replace both his current and cumulated points so that it would be below the threshold of the tier!

**Q**: Is there a limit to my customers' cumulated points? <br />
**A**: There is currently a limit of 999999 cumulated points for every customer. Do not fret as we will look into increasing this limit in future releases!
