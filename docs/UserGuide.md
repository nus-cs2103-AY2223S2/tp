# 3. Quick Start Guide

## 3.1 Layout

Let's take a look at the different components in ConnectUS.<br>

![Layout](images/Layout.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 3.1.1 Command Box

![CommandBox](images/CommandBox.png)

The command box allows you to enter commands that you wish to perform. For starters, try typing the `help` command and hit enter!

### 3.1.2 Command Result Feedback

![CommandResultFeedback](images/CommandResultFeedback.png)

The command result feedback box will provide you with a feedback message after a command is entered. For example, after typing `help`, you should see the above feedback in your ConnectUS application, along with a new Help Window!

If you enter an unrecognized command or a command with the wrong format, an error message will be shown in this feedback box:<br>

![CommandFeedbackInvalid](images/CommandFeedbackInvalid.png)

You can then use the scroll bars of the feedback box to navigate through the feedback given.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### 3.1.3 Contact List

![ContactList](images/ContactList.png)

The contact list shows the contacts that exist within your ConnectUS with all their registered information fields.

* There is a scroll bar beside the contact list container for you to scroll through your contact list.
* The index beside the contact name is the contact's index. It is used for certain commands such as `delete`. More details on this can be found in [Features](#4-features).
* The list of information fields and their details can be found in [Information Fields & Prefixes](#5-information-fields--prefixes).
* You can also find a condensed summary table of these information fields in the [Prefix Summary](#8-prefix-summary).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.2 Key Definitions

### 3.2.1 Command

Commands are actions that you want to perform using ConnectUS. Most commands will require user inputs, otherwise known as [parameters](#322-parameter), for ConnectUS to perform the action.

### 3.2.2 Parameter

Parameters are user inputs that ConnectUS requires to perform certain [commands](#321-command).

Example: `n/NAME`

In this case, `NAME` is the information field that you wish to input. The `n/` prefix must be used for ConnectUS to recognise that you intend on adding a `NAME` to a contact.

* The list of information fields, prefixes and their details can be found in [Information Fields & Prefixes](#5-information-fields--prefixes).
* You can also find a condensed summary of these information fields in the [Prefix Summary](#8-prefix-summary).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: **Note:**<br>

As of now, using non-English languages (e.g. Chinese, French) as information fields are not yet supported. Be sure to look out for it in a future iteration!

</div>

## 3.3 Command Format

To use ConnectUS, type the [command](#321-command) along with its [parameters](#322-parameter), if required. You can leave the parameters empty if it is optional (i.e. if it is wrapped in square brackets like this: `help [COMMAND]`).

* The detailed list of commands and their command formats can be found in [Features](#4-features).
* You can also find a condensed summary of these commands in the [Command Summary](#7-command-summary).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:memo: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the information fields (referred to as *parameters*) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [b/BIRTHDAY]` can be used as `n/John Doe b/14/02/2000` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[mod/MODULE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `mod/CS2103T` (i.e. 1 time), `mod/CS2103T mod/CS2107` (i.e. 2 times) etc.

* Information fields can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameter for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* Commands are case-sensitive!<br>
  e.g. if you specify `ADD n/James` or `aDd n/James` instead of `add n/James`, ConnectUS will not register it as a valid command.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.4 How to Use the CLI

To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), you can type a [command](#321-command) in the [Command Box](#311-command-box) and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   ![Command Box](images/ConnectUSCommandBox.png) <br>

To familiarise yourself with ConnectUS, let's try out [the `add` command](#44-adding-a-contact-add) ! The `add` command allows you to add a new contact into the [Contact List](#313-contact-list).

**Format:** `add n/NAME [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [tg/TELEGRAM] [ig/INSTAGRAM] [wa/WHATSAPP] [b/BIRTHDAY] [mod/MODULE]…​ [cca/CCA[#CCA_POSITION]]…​ [maj/MAJOR]…​ [r/REMARK]…​`

**What does Format mean?**

The first word of every command allows ConnectUS to distinguish different commands.

* `add` tells ConnectUS that this command is to add a new contact
* Prefixes such as `n/` and `p/` are delimiters that allow ConnectUS to distinguish different parameters from the input that you supply
* Information fields such as `NAME` and `PHONE` show you what you should place in each portion of the command.

Notice how there are square brackets `[]` surrounding certain parameters like in `[p/PHONE]`. This indicates that the parameter is **optional**, i.e. a contact can exist even if it does not have this field.

Other parameters that end with `…​` like in `[mod/MODULE]…​` indicates that this parameter can be used multiple times.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**Let's test this out!**

Suppose you have a friend whose nickname is Lineup Larry. His phone number is 91234567, and he stays on campus in UTown Residences. His Telegram username is lineuplarry, takes the modules CS2103T and CS2101, and is in the Art Club.

>`NAME`: Lineup Larry<br>
>`PHONE`: 91234567<br>
>`ADDRESS`: UTown Residences<br>
>`TELEGRAM`: lineuplarry<br>
>`MODULE`: CS2103T, CS2101<br>
>`CCA`: Art Club

The command you would enter into the command box would be:<br>
`add n/Lineup Larry p/91234567 a/UTown Residences tg/lineuplarry mod/CS2103T mod/CS2101 cca/Art Club`

Go ahead and hit enter once you've entered the command. If you have a new contact added in the Contact List as follows:<br>
![NewContactTutorial](images/NewContactTutorial.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully added your first contact!

There are many other features in ConnectUS. Do refer to the [Features](#4-features) below for details on each feature and command!

</div>

[↑ Back to feature list](#4-features)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 4.5 Editing a contact: `edit`

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [ig/INSTAGRAM] [tg/TELEGRAM] [wa/WHATSAPP] [b/BIRTHDAY]`

>Edits an existing contact in the ConnectUS app.

If you accidentally added the wrong information when [adding a contact](#44-adding-a-contact-add), or if you want to update your contacts' information, you use the `edit`  command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

If you want to edit a contact's tags, refer to these guides on <a href="#46-adding-additional-tags-to-a-contact-add-t" class="alert-link">Adding Additional Tags</a> or <a href="#47-deleting-tags-from-a-contact-delete-t" class="alert-link">Deleting Existing Tags</a> instead!

</div>

The `edit` command:

* Edits the contact at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided (e.g. `n/NAME`, `tg/TELEGRAM`).
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Please refer to [Information Fields & Prefixes](#5-information-fields--prefixes) for details on how to use each parameter prefix.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

ConnectUS helps you to detect duplicate contacts by checking the existing contacts for the exact same name (case-sensitive) whenever you edit an existing contact.

</div>
<br>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: **Note:**<br>

As of now, removing a contact's information field is not yet supported. Be sure to look out for it in a future iteration!

</div>

[↑ Back to feature list](#4-features)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 4.6 Adding additional tags to a contact: `add-t`

Format: `add-t PERSON_INDEX [r/REMARK] [mod/MODULE] [cca/CCA[#CCA_POSITION]] [maj/MAJOR]`

> Adds a tag to an existing contact.

If you want to add a new tag to a contact, you can use the `add-t` command.

The `add-t` command:
* Adds a tag to the contact at the specified `PERSON_INDEX`. The `PERSON_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided (e.g. `r/REMARK_NAME`, `mod/MODULE_CODE`).
* A new tag will be created and assigned to the person specified at the `PERSON_INDEX`.
* No duplicate tags are allowed. This means that if there is a pre-existing **tag type** with a certain tag name, the tag will not show up in the UI.
  * e.g. If there is an existing **remark** tag for `classmates` for `PERSON_INDEX` 1, doing `add-t 1 r/classmates` _WILL NOT_ add an additional **remark** tag.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**Add Tag Example:**

**Input in Command Box:** `add-t 1 r/friends mod/CS2103T`

**Before:**<br>![AddTagBefore](images/AddTagBefore.png)

**After:**<br>![AddTagAfter](images/AddTagAfter.png)

[↑ Back to feature list](#4-features)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 4.7 Deleting tags from a contact: `delete-t`

Format: `delete-t PERSON_INDEX [r/REMARK_INDEX] [mod/MODULE_INDEX] [cca/CCA_INDEX] [maj/MAJOR_INDEX]`

> Deletes an existing tag from an existing contact.

If you want to delete an existing tag from a contact, you can use the `delete-t` command.

The `delete-t` command:
* Deletes a tag from the contact at the specified `PERSON_INDEX`. The `PERSON_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
* The `REMARK_INDEX`, `MODULE_INDEX`, `CCA_INDEX` and `MAJOR_INDEX` refer to the index of the tag shown in the respective tag types, from left to right, starting from index 1.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

For example, the Module tags are indexed from 1 to 3 as follows:

![DeleteTagIndexContactExample](images/DeleteTagIndexContactExample.png)

* All indexes (i.e. `PERSON_INDEX`, `REMARK_INDEX`, `MODULE_INDEX`, `CCA_INDEX`, `MAJOR_INDEX`) **must be a positive integer** e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided (i.e. `r/REMARK_INDEX`, `mod/MODULE_INDEX`, `cca/CCA_INDEX`, `maj/MAJOR_INDEX`).
* The specified tag will be deleted from the contact specified at the `PERSON_INDEX`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: **Note:**<br>

As of now, tags can only be deleted one at a time. If there is more than one occurrence of a parameter, only the last one will be taken.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**Delete Tag Example:**

**Input in Command Box:** `delete-t 1 mod/2`

**Before:**<br>![AddTagAfter](images/DeleteTagIndexContactExample.png)

**After:**<br>![DeleteTagAfter](images/DeleteTagAfter.png)

The `delete` command:

* Deletes the contact at the specified `PERSON_INDEX`.
* The `PERSON_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**Delete Example 1:**

`list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd contact in the ConnectUS app.

**Before:**<br>![DeleteBefore1](images/DeleteBefore1.png)

## 4.9 Searching for contact information: `search`

Format: `search [KEYWORD]... [n/NAME_KEYWORD] [p/PHONE_KEYWORD] [e/EMAIL_KEYWORD] [b/BIRTHDAY_KEYWORD] [ig/INSTAGRAM_KEYWORD] [wa/WHATSAPP_KEYWORD] [tg/TELEGRAM_KEYWORD] [r/REMARK_KEYWORD]... [mod/MODULE_KEYWORD]... [cca/CCA_KEYWORD#CCA_POSITION_KEYWORD]... [maj/MAJOR_KEYWORD]...`

> For keywords without a specified field, finds all contacts whose information from any field contains the given keywords.<br>For keywords in a specified field, finds all contacts whose field contains given keyword.

There are 2 methods which you can use concurrently to search for a contact.

**Method 1:**

Using `search KEYWORD` will return a list of all the contacts that match the `KEYWORD` in _ANY_ of their information fields.

For example, if you have 2 contacts, one with the name January, and another with a birthday in January, `search January` will return both those contacts.

**Method 2:**

Using `search` with prefixes (e.g. `search n/NAME_KEYWORD`) will return a list of contacts with that match the information field given by the prefix.

From the earlier example, if you have 2 contacts, one with the name January, and another with a birthday in January, `search n/January` will only return the contact whose name is January.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**Additional Examples:**
* `search january` returns all contacts whose information fields contain the keyword `january`.
* `search alex may` returns all contacts whose information fields contain the keywords `alex` and `may`.
* `search may blk n\alex` returns all contacts whose name contains the keyword `alex` and which contain the keywords `may` and `blk` in any of the information fields.
* `search n\lex y`returns all contacts whose name contains the keyword `lex y`
* `search n\alex b\may` returns all contacts whose name contains the keyword `alex` and whose birthday contains the keyword `may`
* `search mod\cs mod\ma` returns all contacts who have at least one module which contains the keyword `cs` and at least one module which contain the keyword `ma`
* `search ig\al cca\chess` returns all contacts whose instagram handle contains the keyword `al` and who has at least one cca with the word `chess` in it
* `search cca\#president` returns all contacts who have a position that contains the keyword `president` in at least one cca

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

* The keywords are case-insensitive! This means that `search january`, `search JANUARY` and `search jAnUaRy` will all return the contacts whose information fields contain the keyword `january`.<br>

* Only unspecified keywords treat space as a separator. This means `search yu alex` will search for a contact that contains both `yu` and `alex` in the information, but `search n/yu alex` will search for a contact that contains the string `yu alex` in its name. <br>

* If you have 2 contacts, one with the name January, and another with a birthday in January, `search n/January` will return _ONLY_ the contact whose name is January.

## 4.10 Opening a social media platform: `open`

Format: `open PERSON_INDEX [tg/] [wa/] [ig/]`

> Opens the respective social media platform of an existing contact.

You can directly open supported social media platforms (i.e. Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp) from the CLI.

For WhatsApp, if a handle stored is an 8-digit phone number, it will be assumed as a Singaporean number and the `65` country code will be automatically filled.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

You'll need to download the desktop applications for <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org/" class="alert-link">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download" class="alert-link">WhatsApp</a> respectively if you want to use these features!

</div>

## 4.11 Opening a social media platform with prefilled message: `chat`

Format: `chat PERSON_INDEX wa/ m/MESSAGE`

> Opens the respective social media platform of an existing contact with specified message prefilled.

Due to platform constraints, only WhatsApp is supported.

Similar to `open`, if a WhatsApp handle stored is an 8-digit phone number, it will be assumed as a Singaporean number and the `65` country code will be automatically filled.

All your existing messages in the text field will be replaced.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**<br>

You'll need to download the desktop application for <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download" class="alert-link">WhatsApp</a> if you want to use this feature!

Note that WhatsApp might not be responsive enough to prefill the message for you. In this case, you can execute the command once again.
