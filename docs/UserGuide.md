## Quick start
Follow these steps if this is your first time using ExecutivePro:

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
    1. If you have already installed Java, check that you have Java version `11`.
        - If you are using Windows, open up command prompt and type `java -version` and enter.
        - If you are using Mac, open up terminal and type `java -version` and enter.
    2. If you do not have Java `11`:
        - If you are using Windows/Linux/Intel-based Mac, you can download the latest version of Java from
          [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
        - If you are using an Apple Silicon Mac, you can install the Azul build of OpenJDK 11 version
          from [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx).
2. Download the latest `ExecutivePro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/releases).
3. Create a folder on your computer that you want to use as the _main folder_ for ExecutivePro and move `ExecutivePro.jar` to that folder.
   For example, we create a `test` folder on our Desktop.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="images/jarfile.png" width="80%" height="50%">
      <br>
      <em>test folder</em>
    </p>

    Next, we place the `ExecutivePro.jar` file in the `test` folder as shown below.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="images/jarfile2.png" width="80%" height="50%">
      <br>
      <em>ExecutivePro jar file</em>
    </p>

4. Now you are ready to use ExecutivePro, refer to the section [Starting ExecutivePro](#starting-executivepro) below for more details.

</p>

In this section, you can enter your commands in the text box and click enter on your keyboard to send it to the application. 

This is also known as a Command Line Interface or CLI for short. If you are new to CLI, a short introduction is available below.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb:
<u> What is CLI?</u> <br>

To understand CLI better, here is an analogy:
Imagine being in a restaurant with a talented chef in the kitchen. The chef represents the computer while a waiter is a button on your screen. Instead of having to go through the waiter or "click" a button, the CLI helps you communicate directly with the chef by giving specific instructions or "orders" about what you want to eat. Hence, the CLI is a way to interact with your computer by giving precise, text-based instructions, much like talking directly to a chef to customize your meal. <br> <br>

<u> Why use CLI?</u> <br>

Using a CLI can greatly enhance your efficiency as you no longer have to toggle between the mouse and your keyboard. Don't worry if this is your first time using the CLI, you'll get used to it in no time. <br> <br>

<u> How to use the CLI?</u> <br>

Simply type in a command in the text box and press enter on your keyboard to execute it. To execute additional commands, continue typing and hit enter after each one is completed. <br>

## Employee Profiles

ExecutivePro makes it easy for you to add, remove, or edit employee information. ExecutivePro builds an employee profile for every employee to store their personal particulars. These are the employee information that ExecutivePro can help you keep track of:

| Particular      | Description                                   | Compulsory?                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|

In addition, you can upload a profile picture for each employee (click [here](#setting-an-employees-picture--setpicture)),
that will be shown in the display panel when the employee is selected.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb:
Tags can be used to record any information about your employees that does not fall into any of the above categories.
For example, you could:

<ul>
    <li>Tag an employee as "Software Engineer" to record their role within their department.</li>
    <li>Tag an employee as "Vegetarian" to take note of their dietary requirements.</li>
</ul>

Tags give you more flexibility in building employee profiles, so you can use ExecutivePro to its fullest!

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features
This section lists the details of all the features of ExecutivePro.

### Help Command

#### Viewing help : `help`
We know that there can be a lot of information to take in for a new user, so if you ever _feel lost_ while using ExecutivePro, getting help is just a simple step away.

Entering the `help` command will open up the _Help Window_ that looks like this.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/helpwindow.png" width="100%" height="50%">
  <br>
  <em>Help Window</em>
</p>

On the left column, you can find the full list of ExecutivePro commands and on the right are the details for each command. If you require more information, the _Help Window_ also contains a button at the bottom to open up this User Guide in your browser.

Format: `help`

<a href="#toc">Back to Table of Contents</a>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Import/Export of Employee Details

#### Adding an employee: `add`

How do we build an employee profile?

The first step is to add a new employee using the `add` command along with any particulars that you want to include in the input format specified below.

Upon successfully adding a new employee, ExecutivePro will then keep track of the new employee profile in the
database, and you are free to access and modify the particulars later on with the [`edit`](#editing-an-employee--edit) command.

However, this function could fail (and ExecutivePro does not add the employee), if:

1. There are missing compulsory particulars. You can refer to the input format below for help, or find the list of compulsory particulars [here](#employee-profiles).
2. The particulars are in the wrong format, the program will prompt you on the correct format. Alternatively, you can find them [here](#field-formats).
3. The new employee added is a duplicate, i.e. there is someone in the database who already shares the same name, phone number and email. 


Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER d/DEPARTMENT pr/PAYROLL [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [l/LEAVE_COUNT] [dob/DATE_OF_BIRTH] [doj/DATE_OF_JOINING] [t/TAG]...`


Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 d/Marketing pr/1000 15 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe p/1234567 d/Sales pr/4000 1 e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate street, block 576, #01-02 dob/2000-04-21 doj/2022-01-04 t/friend`

<br>

#### Adding multiple employees at once: `batchadd`

Tired of adding new employees one by one?
ExecutivePro allows you to add multiple employees at once from a `.csv` file.
This feature will come in handy if:

1. You are a new user and have your existing employee data stored in a `.csv` file.
2. There has been a recruitment cycle and the company has multiple new employees.

With this feature, you would not need to spend time to manually add each employee in!

Format: `batchadd FILENAME`

Example:
- `batchadd executivepro.csv`


Here are the steps to use this command:

**Step 1 (Creating CSV file) :**

Things to note:

- A header row is required to indicate the purpose of the field and must be the first row in the CSV file.
- For multiple tags for an employee, the tags should be separated by "/".


Sample CSV file:
   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/successCSV.png" width="80%" height="80%">
     <br>
     <em>Sample CSV file</em>
   </p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning:
**Caution:** For the fields, do ensure that they follow the same specifications as in the [Field Formats below](#field-formats).

</div>

**Step 2 (Uploading CSV file) :**
Before we proceed to uploading the CSV file, you would need to have followed the instructions 
at the start of the user guide,  in order
to upload your csv file in the `data` folder

Once that is done,

1. Go to the folder where you stored the `jar` file.
2. Move your desired CSV file to the `data` folder.
   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/movingFile.png" width="100%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Location of CSV file to be placed in</em>
   </p>

**Step 3 (Running CSV file) :**

1. Once done, run `batchadd FILENAME` in the CLI.

If the command is successful, the employees in the file should be added to the database like below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/batchaddsuccess.png" width="75%" height="50%">
  <br>
  <em>Successful batchadd of employees</em>
</p>

The command could be unsuccessful, and there are a few potential causes of this:

1. There could be a *duplicate* entry in the file, i.e. two employees sharing the same identity in the file.
2. If any of the particulars in the wrong format, ExecutivePro will not be able to read the file properly
   and the command will not run.
3. If you are using Excel to open your CSV file, the date formatting in Excel might not be set to the right format,
please refer to the instructions [here](#opening-csv-files-in-excel)

In the case of an unsuccessful Batch Add, **NONE** of the employees in the CSV will be added.
Also note that as of version `1.3` , this feature only supports CSV files and adding employees with the fields mentioned above.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

##### Opening .csv files in Excel 

When using the `batchadd` feature, it is crucial to ensure that the dates in the CSV file are in the [correct format](#field-formats).
ExecutivePro expects dates to be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD. If the dates in your CSV file are in a different format, you'll need to convert them before uploading the file to prevent errors and unsuccessful imports.

Follow the steps below to ensure the dates in Excel are following the correct format:

1. Firstly, you can select the two columns involving dates, `Date of Birth` and `Date of Joining`, just like the image below.
   <p align="center">
    <img src="images/selectingcolumns.png" width="80%" height="80%">
    <br>
    <em>Selecting date columns in Excel file</em>
   </p>
2. Next, right-click on the selected columns so that the following shows up:
   <p align="center">
    <img src="images/rightclick.png" width="30%" height="30%">
    <br>
    <em>Right click to format selected cells</em>
   </p>

3. Click on `Format Cells...` and the table below will appear:
   <p align="center">
    <img src="images/format.png" width="70%" height="60%">
    <br>
    <em>Format cells table</em>
   </p>

4. Click on `Date`:
   <p align="center">
    <img src="images/formatdate.png" width="70%" height="60%">
    <br>
    <em>Clicking on date</em>
   </p>

5. Select the correct date format ("YYYY-MM-DD"):
   <p align="center">
    <img src="images/correct.png" width="70%" height="60%">
    <br>
    <em>Correct date format</em>
   </p>

6. Click `OK` and the date in the file will be updated to the correct format:
   <p align="center">
    <img src="images/successCSV.png" width="100%" height="100%">
    <br>
    <em>Correct date format in Excel file</em>
   </p>


Once the dates in your CSV file are in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD),
you can proceed with the batchadd command in ExecutivePro.
This will ensure a smooth import process, and all employee information,
including dates, will be properly stored in the database.

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

#### Exporting database into CSV file: `batchexport`

ExecutivePro allows you to export the employees' data into a CSV file.

Format: `batchexport FILENAME`

Example:
- `batchexport exported_database.csv`


Here are the steps to use this command:

**Step 1 (Exporting to CSV file) :**

1. Run `batchexport FILENAME` in the command panel. The result should look like the image below.
   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/exportedFile.png" width="100%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Successful batchexport of database</em>
   </p>

2. Go to the folder where you stored the `jar` file.

3. Locate the CSV file in the `data` folder.

If the command is successful, there should be CSV file that contains all the employees' details from the database,
and it should look something like the below image.

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/exportedFileLocation.png" width="100%" height="100%">
     <br>
     <em>Location of exported CSV file</em>
   </p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:warning: Caution:
If you open the exported `.csv file` in `Excel`
and save it without ensuring that the date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD), the dates might be saved in a different format, 
leading to issues when importing the file using the batchadd command. 
To ensure the correct date format is saved, please refer to the instructions [here](#opening-csv-files-in-excel)
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:warning: Caution:
**Do take note to only export in `.csv file` and not any other file types.**

### Editing Employee Details

#### Editing an employee : `edit`

There could be instances where you have to edit the details of an employee. It could be due to a typo or that your employee has changed their personal particulars. Simply follow the format given below to edit those details.

Format: `edit EMPLOYEE_ID [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [d/DEPARTMENT] [pr/PAYROLL] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [l/LEAVE_COUNT] [dob/DATE_OF_BIRTH] [doj/DATE_OF_JOINING] [t/TAG]...`

* Edits the details of the employee with the specified `EMPLOYEE_ID`. If such an employee doesnâ€™t exist, an error message will be shown.
* At least one of the optional fields (in brackets above) must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the personâ€™s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Changes the phone number and email address of the employee with ID `1` to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

Here are the steps to use this command:

**Step 1 (Inputting the edit command) :**
You can use the command syntax to edit an employee's fields, the image below demonstrates the command `edit 1 p/91234567`.

#### Taking leave : `leave`

There are plenty of instances where employees take leave, and it is such a tedious task to manage employee leaves. ExecutivePro allows you to help your employees take leave so you no longer have to manually track remaining leaves for each employee. Note that for resetting or increasing an employee's leave count use the `edit` command above instead. (`leave` can only help an employee take leave).

Format: `leave EMPLOYEE_ID l/LEAVE_COUNT`

* Helps the employee with the specified `EMPLOYEE_ID` take leave. If such an employee doesnâ€™t exist, an error message will be shown.
* Number of days of leave is specified by `LEAVE_COUNT`. If the employee does not have enough remaining leave, an error message will be shown.
* Existing leave count will decrease by the number of days of leave taken.

Examples:
* `leave 1 l/3` Helps the employee with ID `1` take `3` days of leave.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

#### Setting an employee's picture : `setpicture`

This feature allows you to set a profile picture for the specified employee, by uploading an image file from your computer into the ExecutivePro database.

:warning: **Note:**
The selected image file must be in either the `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` file formats.

Format: `setpicture EMPLOYEE_ID`

* Sets the picture of the employee with the specified `EMPLOYEE_ID`.
* The `EMPLOYEE_ID` refers to the id of an employee shown in the displayed employees list.
* The `EMPLOYEE_ID` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹

Examples:
- `setpicture 1` sets the picture for the employee with EMPLOYEE_ID 1.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Below are the steps to use this command:

**Step 1 (Inputting the command) :**

Run the setpicture command e.g. `setpicture 1` in the CLI.
A file explorer window should appear, as shown below:

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/SetPictureCommand1.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>File selector appearing</em>
   </p>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**Step 2 (Selecting an image) :**

Search through your computer for the image you want to set as the employee's profile picture.
Click on the image in your file explorer to select it,
then open it by clicking the "Open" button on the file explorer or by pressing the "Enter" key on your keyboard.

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/SetPictureCommand2.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Choosing image</em>
   </p>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

**Step 3 (Seeing the result) :**

Click on the specified employee in the employee list.
ExecutivePro should now display the employee's picture in the display panel as shown below.

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/SetPictureCommand3.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Picture displayed on display panel for selected employee</em>
   </p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning:
**Note:** If a file not originally in one of the valid file formats is renamed to a valid file format,
the file may not be properly displayed (e.g. renaming a `example.txt` file to a `example.png`). We encourage you to use an image converter to convert your image to the valid file format,
before uploading it to ExecutivePro.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

#### Deleting an employee : `delete`

As time passes, you might run into instances where an employee leaves the company, and that their details have to be removed
from the database. `delete` would help to remove the details of the employee with the specified `EMPLOYEE_ID`
from the ExecutivePro database.

Format: `delete EMPLOYEE_ID`

* You can delete the details of the employee with the specific `EMPLOYEE_ID`.
* The `EMPLOYEE_ID` refers to the id of an employee shown in the displayed employees list.
* The `EMPLOYEE_ID` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹

Examples:
- `delete 2` deletes the employee with EMPLOYEE_ID 2 in ExecutivePro.

#### Clearing the data: `clear`

Clears all the data currently stored in the database.

If you are a new user, you can use this command after you have experimented with ExecutivePro to start keying in your actual employee information.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: **Caution:**
Once you run this command, you lose all data immediately.

### Viewing Employee Details

#### Locating employees by keyword: `find`

As your database gets larger, scrolling and finding a certain employee becomes harder. However, ExecutivePro will ease this process
through the `find` command. This command helps you find employees using their names and/or departments.

Format: `find [*] KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* `find` command finds employees using the keyword you input. Those keywords can only be used to find the employee's name or their department.
* If asterisk (`*`) is inputted, it displays a list of employees matching _all_ the given keywords.
* If asterisk (`*`) is _not_ inputted, it displays a list of employees matching _any_ of the given keywords.
* For name, even if there is a partial match between your keyword and the employees name, that employee will be listed.
* For department, there has to be a full match between your keyword and the employee's department.

Examples:
* `find John Sales` displays a list of all employees whose full name contains a 'John' in it,
  or if they are in the 'Sales' department
* `find * John Sales` displays a list of all employees in the 'Sales' department _and_ who have a 'John' in their name


Here are the steps to use this command:

**Step 1 (Inputting the search keywords) :**
Following the command format above,
you can find employees with the specified keywords, just like the image below.
   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/findInterface.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Input search keywords: "Alex Marketing"</em>
   </p>

**Step 2 (Results displayed) :**
All the employees who match the keywords will be listed.
   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/findResults.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Results after find command is entered</em>
   </p>

#### Filtering out employees: `filter`

Similar to the `find` command, the `filter` command helps you to search for employees by their salaries or remaining leave counts.
Furthermore, you can find employees whose salaries/leave counts are greater than/lesser than/equal to a specified amount.

Format: `filter FILTER_PARAMETER BOOLEAN_OPERATOR COMPARISON_AMOUNT`

* You can create your own condition based on which the employees will be filtered.
* The filtering condition can be `pr` (for employee salaries) or `l` (for remaining leave counts).
* The filtering condition checks the salaries or leave counts of employees against a `COMPARISON_AMOUNT`.
* The filtering condition can either be greater than (`>`), lesser than (`<`) or equal to (`=`) the `COMPARISON_AMOUNT`.
* The `COMPARISON_AMOUNT` must be a _non-negative_ integer.

Examples:
* `filter pr > 1000` displays a list of all employees whose salaries are greater than 1000
* `filter l = 1` displays a list of all employees who have only 1 leave left

Here are the steps to use this command:

**Step 1 (Creating the criteria) :**
Following the command format above, 
you can filter for employees with salaries greater than 500, just like the image below.

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/filterInterface.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Filtering employees with salaries greater than 500</em>
   </p>

**Step 2 (Results displayed) :**
All the employees who have satisfied the criteria will be listed.
   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/filterResults.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Results displayed after filter command is entered</em>
   </p>

#### Listing all employees : `list`

After searching for employees using the `find` command, you might realise that the employee list no longer shows all the employees.
In order to get the full list back, simply use the list command, and it will show a list of all employees and
their details in the ExecutivePro database.

Format: `list`

### System commands

#### Changing the UI theme : `theme`

Want to tweak the look of ExecutivePro?
This feature allows you to choose one of two appearances for ExecutivePro to suit your needs.

The `light` theme (black text on light background) improves readability in well-lit surroundings.

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/ThemeCommandLight.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Light Theme</em>
   </p>

The `dark` theme (white text on dark background) can reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/ThemeCommandDark.png" width="75%" height="50%">
     <br>
     <em>Dark Theme</em>
   </p>

Format: `theme THEME_NAME`
* `THEME_NAME` is either `dark` (white text on dark background) or `light` (black text on white background).

Example:
- `theme light` applies the `light` theme to ExecutivePro.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning:
**Note:** Themes are not kept upon closing ExecutivePro.
</div>

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. Your data is automatically saved so ExecutivePro will look exactly the same the next time you open it up.

Format: `exit`

<a href="#toc">Back to Table of Contents</a>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Saving/Editing the data file
ExecutivePro data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

The employee data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/executivepro.json`. 
Advanced users can edit the JSON file directly but are strongly discouraged due to possible data corruption.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ExecutivePro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
