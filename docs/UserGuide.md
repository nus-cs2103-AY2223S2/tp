# GoodMatch

## **Overview**

GoodMatch (GM) is a **desktop app for managing applicants and job listings, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), specifically catering to HR managers in charge of tracking job listings across many platforms. If you can type fast, GM can get your applicant and job listing management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The ID will be displayed (behind the applicant's name) in the case that there are two or more applicants with identical names in the same listing.


> If the listing has only one applicant named *Tom*, the applicant will be displayed as `Tom`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be **supplied by the user**. E.g. in `add t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Chicken Rice Uncle`.


- Items in square brackets are **optional**. E.g. `t/TITLE [a/APPLICANT]...` can be used as `t/Chicken Rice Uncle a/John Tan` or as `t/Chicken Rice Uncle`.


- Items with `‚Ä¶` after them can be used **multiple times** including **zero times**. E.g. `[a/APPLICANT]‚Ä¶` can be used as `` (i.e. 0 times), `a/applicant1`, `a/applicant2 a/application3` etc.


- Parameters can be in **any order**. E.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION t/TITLE` is also acceptable.


- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken. E.g. if you specify `t/Chicken Rice Uncle t/Chicken Rice Auntie`, only `t/Chicken Rice Auntie` will be taken.


- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view` and `exit`) will be **ignored**. E.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

  `edit 1 t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`

  then only the title and the description of listing 1 will be edited (the applicants will remain unchanged)
- Editing the title to an already existing title is not allowed since it leads to duplicated listings.
- For platforms and applicants, editing using the `p/` and `a/` flags will replace the whole list with the new list. E.g. if the command entered is:

  `edit 1 p/LinkedIn p/Indeed a/`
  
  then the list of platforms will be edited to [LinkedIn, Indeed] while the list of applicants will be empty.
- To manage individual applicants in a listing, consider using the [`add_app`](#adding-an-applicant-to-listing-add_app), [`del_app`](#deleting-an-applicant-from-a-listing-del_app) or [`edit_app`](#editing-an-applicant-of-a-listing-edit_app) commands.
- To manage individual platforms in a listing, consider using the [`add_plat`](#adding-a-platform-add_plat) or [`del_plat`](#delete-a-platform-from-a-listing-del_plat) commands.

- `edit 1 t/Noodle seller d/Cooks tasty noodles a/Johnson p/Glints`

### Undo latest command: `undo`

You can undo your latest executed command that 
modifies the listing book using our `undo` command.

‚úèÔ∏è **Format:** `undo`

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Notes:**
- Commands that are not undoable include:
  - `help`, `view`, `exit`, `find` & `sort`.
- `Undo` still works after a `find` command, to visually see the effects of 
`undo` execute a `view` command.
  

üéØ **Expected Output:**

Previous change should be reversed and a confirmation message will show:

```ignorelang
Undo success
```

‚ùå **Possible Errors:**
If there aren't any commands that can be undone (i.e. when you first open GoodMatch or when all 
undoable commands have been undone), an error message will be shown:

<p>
  <img class="diagram" src="images/UndoError.png"/>
  <em>Undo error message</em>
</p>

‚ùó**Caution** 
`undo` is irreversible. If you want to reverse an `undo` you can retype the command that was undone.

‚ùó**Caution**
Once you exit GoodMatch, all command history will be wiped.
Meaning you can't undo commands executed before the app was closed.
