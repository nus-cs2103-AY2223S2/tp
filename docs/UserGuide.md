## How to Get Started

#### 1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

* To check if you have Java `11` installed, follow these steps
* `java -version` <br>
* You should have the following output:
  ![Java-version](images/java-version.png)

#### 2. Download the latest `advisio.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/releases).

#### 3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Advisio.

#### 4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the command to run the application. <br>

* To open up the command terminal, follow these steps
* **Mac**: `Cmd + space` to open up spotlight, now search terminal and press `Enter`.
* **Windows**: `Windows + R` top open 'Run' box. Type `cmd` and then click 'ok'.

  to Advisio clientele.

* `undo` : Undo the previous command `delete 3`. Thus original 3rd client shown in list will come back

* `redo` : Redo the previous command `delete 3`. Thus 3rd client will be deleted again from list

* `clear` : Deletes all clients.

* `exit` : Exits the app.
* `select 1` : Selects the client indexed as `#0001`.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Some notes about the command format**<br>

* Words in the grey box are commands or parameters that the user are able to type into the application.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `edit INDEX n/[NAME] p/[PHONE]` can be used as `edit 1 n/John Doe p/1234578` or as `edit 1 n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `find KEYWORD [KEYWORD]...` can be used as `find alice`, `find alice ben` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: My computer doesn't have Java 11 installed, what should I do?<br>
**A**: You can install Java 11
from [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html). All you have to do now
is find your operating systems and follow the steps given! Alternatively, you can also install Java 11
from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org).

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous clientele home folder.

**Q**: Do I need an internet connection use Advisio?<br>
**A**: Advisio is a local application that does not require an internet connection! Feel free to use our application
anywhere and anytime as you see fit!

**Q**: Is my data stored on the cloud? How can I ensure that I do not lose such critical information?<br>
**A**:Unfortunately, Advisio does not support cloud support. However, you can follow these steps to store your data
safely in existing cloud services such as Icloud or Google Drive. Firstly, locate the data
file `<JAR file location>/data/clientbook.json`. Secondly, copy the file into your preferred cloud service.

**Q**: I would like to add a new policy, however the application doesn't allow me to add a policy other than those that
are supported by the application. What should I do?<br>
**A**: We restricted the policies to a limited few for the convenience of Financial Advisors so that they wouldn't find
themselves in a situation where they can't remember the policy that was added. The engineering team for your company
should be able to add a new general policy if it's required.

**Q**: Is there a limit to the number of clients or policies that I can add?<br>
**A**: There is approximately a 2 million limit for both clients and policies separately. We have analysed and
interviewed veteran Financial Advisors and have concluded that it is very unlikely for a Financial Advisor to to exceed
those thresholds. However, the limit can be expanded in the future if necessary.
