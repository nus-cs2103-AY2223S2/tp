/**
 * A list of suppliers that enforces uniqueness between its elements and does not allow nulls.
 * A supplier is considered unique by comparing using {@code Supplier#isSameItem(Item)}. As such, adding and updating of
 * suppliers uses Supplier#isSameItem(Item) for equality to ensure that the supplier being added or updated is unique
 * in terms of identity in the UniqueSupplierList. However, the removal of a supplier uses Supplier#equals(Object) to
 * ensure that the supplier with exactly the same fields will be removed.
 * <p>
 * Supports a minimal set of list operations.
